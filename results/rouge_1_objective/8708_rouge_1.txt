ap mccoy stood with the trainer , jonjo o'neill , in the parade ring .
he was presented the champion jockey trophy by ian wright - mccoy is an arsenal fanatic .
the 40-year-old received a guard of honour before receiving the jockeys to mount .
the two men are great friends but this was one small act of revenge for 20 years of being a bridesmaid .
