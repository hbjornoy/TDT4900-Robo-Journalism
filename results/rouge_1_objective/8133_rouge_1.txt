he and ms rowlatt met in february this year and became engaged in may .
the police allege he was choked and had his head bashed on the pavement by his neighbour , nathan sanchez , who has since been charged with the murder of mr barry .
mr sanchez will next be in southport magistrates court on december 11 .
