jason warnock , 29 , was driving wednesday morning in lewiston , idaho when he saw debris near the road and looked up to see a vehicle crashed into a chain-link fence on the edge of a cliff .
he then parked his car , ran up a pedestrian footbridge and pulled driver matthew sitko , 23 , out of the vehicle .
warnock chatted with sitko for a few minutes , but left as soon as police arrived because he had to get back to work .
warnock has since come forward to identify himself and speak more about the incident .
