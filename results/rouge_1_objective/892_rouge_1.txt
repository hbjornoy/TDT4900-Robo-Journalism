sosefina amoa , 26 , has said she did n't know she was pregnant before she gave birth to a baby boy in her room at the little sisters of the poor convent in washington in early october .
she acknowledged as part of a plea deal in february that after giving birth to her son she put a piece of wool clothing over his nose and mouth and applied pressure , smothering him .
amoa 's attorney , judith pipe , called amoa 's ` generosity of spirit ' for wanting to help others and become a nun , but she said amoa would never have come to the united states .
