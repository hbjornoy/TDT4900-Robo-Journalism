dorothy holm posted images of two index cards , covered in a seemingly unbreakable code , that her grandmother , dorothy holm , had written just weeks before her death in 1996 .
she said the family had been trying to find meaning in the jumble of letters that covered 20 index cards ever since her grandmother died from a brain tumor .
the code was on its way to being solved after a web user spotted a possible method to the madness of jumbled letters .
