connecticut state dental commission voted 5-0 wednesday to suspend the license of dr. rashmi patel , who has offices in enfield and torrington , after finding that he did n't properly care for two patients , including a woman who died in february .
patel 's license will be suspended until he successfully undergoes a review of his practice by the american association of dental board , which may take several months .
he will be on probation for five years after the license suspension is lifted .
patel , 45 , of suffield , denied wrongdoing in both cases .
