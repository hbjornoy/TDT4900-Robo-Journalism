lukas james kamay , 26 , of clifton hill in melbourne 's north east , pleaded guilty to six insider trading charges , but not guilty to the more serious charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime when he appeared in the victorian supreme court .
defence lawyer tony isaacs told the court that kamay would apply to have a permanent stay on the charge if it was not withdrawn .
kamay and a friend christopher russell hill , of belconnen in the act , used his position with the abs to access data on the labour force and retail trade to predict fluctuations in the australian dollar before it was made publicly available .
