ap mccoy rides uxizandre to victory in thursday 's ryanair chase for his 31st cheltenham festival win of 2015 .
ap mccoy 's wife chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been ` melancholy ' after two winless days .
mccoy 's father peadar and jp mcmanus , mccoy 's last festival , will be confined to the recesses of the mccoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his cheltenham career on friday afternoon .
the roar took time to grow but by the time mccoy had returned to the winners ' enclosure .
