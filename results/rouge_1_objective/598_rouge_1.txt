sarah morrison suffers from a rare type of brittle bone disease which has seen her suffer from over 200 broken bones since she was born .
she was admitted to sheffield children 's hospital for surgery to have metal rods inserted into her legs to make her limbs stronger .
her parents , philip morrison and sonia mccrossan , dispute this and the hospital is now carrying out an internal review .
the teeth were loose baby teeth which needed to be removed as they ` posed a serious risk to sarah 's airway ' during surgery .
