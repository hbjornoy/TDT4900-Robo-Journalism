conservationists say the bees can in fact cope with some pesticide use by farmers , if they have wild flowers to feed on and a place to live .
pesticides have been blamed for killing off many bumblebees , as has the loss of 97per cent of the uk 's wild flower meadows since the 1930s due to agricultural intensification and urbanisation .
bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth # 560m a year to the uk economy .
