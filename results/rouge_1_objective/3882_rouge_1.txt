new york times say australian cafes have stamped their identity on the new york food scene .
the bluestone cafe is decorated with australian memorabilia , to bring a little bit of home to new york ` concrete jungle ' mr stone , who in august 2013 opened the first of his ` quintessentially australian ' caf√©s in new york .
mr stone will soon have five cafes located all over new york , with americans embracing the australian coffee experience .
