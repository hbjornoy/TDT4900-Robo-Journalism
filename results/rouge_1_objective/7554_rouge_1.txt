d-day veteran fred cannon , 90 , is left with just # 10 a week from his war pension because the council takes the rest to pay for his care .
the proud great-grandfather , who was 19 when he landed on gold beach in 1944 , said : ' i think it stinks .
i 'm not being funny , but i 've got injuries , and they want to take it away from me .
he is calling on the government to set aside funding so all injured veterans receive the social care they need .
the pension is now worth # 105 per week , plus a # 54 mobility supplement .
