u.s. secretary of state john kerry moved sunday to reassure america 's arab friends that the united states will not allow them to be attacked ` from outside , ' in an apparent warning to iran .
he hopes to mend relations strained by saudi unhappiness with u.s. actions in syria , its tentative warming with iran and stance on egypt , kerry acknowledged differences with some partners but stressed they shared common goals in each case .
he said the body had proved itself largely meaningless because of its inability over two years to address the crisis in syria .
