england team sponsor vauxhall were forced to apologise after breaching security by tweeting team sheets with the players ' passport numbers .
the official fifa team sheets always have the numbers alongside the names of the players , along with their date of birth , but the sensitive passport information is not for publication .
england 's team sheet , with the starting line up and seven substitutes , was handed out 45 minutes before kick off against ecuador in the sun life stadium .
