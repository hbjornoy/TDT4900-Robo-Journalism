barclays premier league footballers will be warned in the next fortnight that they could face retrospective action if they follow the example of england cricketer moeen ali and make a public show of political support on the football pitch .
in light of the current conflicts engulfing the gaza strip , ukraine , libya and syria , both the football association and the premier league are acutely aware of the sensitivities .
moeen ali was banned from wearing ` save gaza ' and ` free palestine ' wristbands by the international cricket council .
