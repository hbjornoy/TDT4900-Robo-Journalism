the two boys , aged two and three , had climbed into the inflatable structure at sullivan farm in nashua , new hampshire on sunday .
the farm 's owner has since said it was not open at the time .
the house went airborne , flew over a fence and then crashed to the ground , leaving the two-year-old child with critical injuries and the older boy with less serious injuries .
the bouncy house can be seen between trees , where it landed after flying 60 feet in the air .
