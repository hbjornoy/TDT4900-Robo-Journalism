doug ibbs and deni daniel appeared on grand designs back in 2004 .
the couple , both divorcees who had met five years previously , bought the tumble-down 19th century manor house on a whim after stumbling across an advert for it online .
the odds did n't look good -- neither of them spoke french , they had no experience with building work and they had n't been intending to move overseas when they bought the house just two days after spotting it in 1944 .
