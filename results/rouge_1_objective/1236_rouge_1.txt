the body of reverend bob thorn , 59 , was washed up on a beach near seatown , just five miles from his parish of burton bradstock , dorset .
he is believed to have been rowing the 150 miles back to his parish along the south coast when he rowed a 10ft wooden boat from his home in dorset to cornwall last month .
the reverend 's body was found in a small cove a few hundred feet along the beach from where his boat was found nearby .
officers say they are not treating the death of mr thorn , who was married to jean , also a priest , and had four children , as suspicious .
