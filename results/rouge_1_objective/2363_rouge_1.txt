arsene wenger praised olivier giroud for his match-winning performance as the france striker 's brace was enough to beat middlesbrough in their fa cup fifth-round meeting .
giroud , who missed his leg in august , reached double figures for the campaign as he struck twice in two first-half minutes as the reigning fa cup holders eased into the last eight .
the 28-year-old remains an important part of wenger 's side despite the summer acquistions of danny welbeck and alexis sanchez .
