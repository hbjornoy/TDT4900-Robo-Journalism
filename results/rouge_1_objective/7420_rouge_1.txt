the egyptian museum in cairo , where the burial mask is kept , is one of the city 's main tourist sites , but in some areas , ancient wooden sarcophagi lay unprotected from the public , while pharaonic burial shrouds mounted on walls crumble behind open glass cases .
they also could not agree whether the beard was knocked off by accident while the mask 's case was being cleaned or if was removed because it was loose .
tutankhamun 's mask , over 3,300 years old , and other contents of his tomb are the museum 's top exhibits .
