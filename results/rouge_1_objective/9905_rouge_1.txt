passenger jin pai , 35 , was standing on the rim of a toilet in hefei xinqiao international airport in the city of hefei , the capital city of eastern china 's anhui province .
he was caught out when the porcelain toilet then tipped over and shattered on the floor , cutting the man in several places .
he had been too embarrassed to shout for help and had hoped they would assist but he was too badly hurt for anything other than an immediate trip to hospital .
the passenger reportedly confessed to his friends that he was ` worried it might not be clean '
