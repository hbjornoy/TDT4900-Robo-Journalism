james corden , known to have a double chin , is injected into the skin over a series of treatments spaced no less than one month apart .
the drug is a type of deoxycholic acid - a naturally-occurring molecule that helps the body break down fat , according to kythera 's website .
it acts ` immediately on targeted fat cells ' but is ` rapidly cleared ' from the chin , leaving surrounded tissue largely unaffected , kythera claims .
