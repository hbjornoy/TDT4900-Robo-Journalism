marley , a vervet monkey , was only two weeks old when an anonymous woman saw him being sold on the street in tanzania .
she then spent 24 hours a day with him and brought him up by hand in her home at the dr jane goodall institute .
the woman , who had bought him from street traders in daar es salaam in an attempt to rescue him , gave him to wildlife worker brittany hilton .
the canadian-norwegian sanctuary worker became his adoptive mother , bottle-feeding him until he could eat fruit on his own and never letting him leave her side .
