north korea 's december 12 rocket launch shows the reclusive asian country has likely developed the technology to fire a warhead that could reach the u.s. west coast from 6,200 miles away , south korean officials said on sunday .
critics say it was aimed at creating the kind of technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile .
north korea is banned from testing missile or nuclear technology under u.n. sanctions imposed after it fired its long-range rocket .
