former east 17 frontman brian harvey vented his anger at the music industry as he smashed up platinum discs he was awarded with the band and then posted a bizarre video of his outburst online .
the 41-year-old then whacks the framed discs against a metal junction box in an alley , shattering the glass and then dumping the wreckage on the paving slabs .
harvey was left with severe injuries in 2005 following a bizarre accident in which he ran over himself , attributing it to overeating and then falling out of his car while vomiting .
he is seen in the alley once more tidying up and placing the debris in a bin .
