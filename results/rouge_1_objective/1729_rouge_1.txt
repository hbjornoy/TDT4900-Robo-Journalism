the u.s. supreme court said tuesday that christian firms can challenge an obamacare mandate that forces employers to offer their staff free contraception as part of their health insurance .
hobby lobby , a crafting supply store owned by a family that also runs a chain of christian bookstores , sued the federal government over obamacare 's requirement that every health insurance policy include coverage for the morning-after pill and intra-uterine contraceptive devices .
they face fines of up to $ 1.3 million per day if they do n't provide birth-control that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman 's uterus .
