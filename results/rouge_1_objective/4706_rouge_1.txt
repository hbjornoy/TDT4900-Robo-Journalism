former chelsea and newcastle boss ruud gullit has questioned how long luis suarez will remain a barcelona player after admitting his surprise at the uruguayan 's # 75million move .
suarez left liverpool last summer to sign for the catalan giants , going on to make his debut in october after returning from a four-month ban for biting giorgio chiellini at the world cup .
the 27-year-old has only scored once in eight la liga appearances so far and gullit is unsure whether he can adapt to life in spain .
