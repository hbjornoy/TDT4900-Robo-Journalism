the billboard , advertising char-grilled steaks , was set on fire at night to create authentic burn marks .
passers-by had spent the previous day , in november , bemused by a large photograph of a raw steak , accompanied by no branding or advertising information .
the stunt promoting the food at double grill and bar , in the city of yekaterinburg , got underway .
two men dressed in chef outfits and armed with a flamethrower set the billboard alight along eight lines .
