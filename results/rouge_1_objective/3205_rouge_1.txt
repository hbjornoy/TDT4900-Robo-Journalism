new menu labeling rules from the food and drug administration will require chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets to list the amount of calories in alcoholic drinks , along with other foods , on menus by next november .
the idea is that people often do n't know -- or even think about how many calories they are imbibing .
the wine list will also be guilt-free -- individual calorie amounts are n't required there either .
