rosie-ann stone , 21 , was overtaking a lorry when she collided with her elder sibling jennie 's death in a car crash as the crown prosecution was criticised for heartlessly pursuing the case .
the women had lost their brother gregg , a 20-year-old soldier who was shot dead while serving in afghanistan .
their father robert stone , 56 , arrived at the scene of the accident and cried : ` not again , no , not another child .
i know jennie is up there now and she would not have wanted rosie-ann to be prosecuted '
