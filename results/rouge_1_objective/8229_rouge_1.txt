lt. col. robert e. underwood , who was arrested monday night and pleaded not guilty to felony harassment charges , was stationed at the same base as the soldier who made headlines over the weekend for allegedly killing 16 afghan civilians in a shooting spree .
he was charged with three counts of felony harassment and is being held in the pierce county jail on $ 250,000 bail .
the base is now being scrutinized as it was also the base of the soldier accused of killing 16 civilians in afghanistan .
