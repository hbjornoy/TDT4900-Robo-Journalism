the palio medieval race has been held twice a year , every year , almost without fail since the mid-1600s .
a total of 10 riders from siena 's 17 districts , or contrade , race bareback around the shell-shaped central square in a bid to win the palio , a silk banner depicting the madonna and child .
the square is covered with sand named ` tufo ' before the racers take to the course .
