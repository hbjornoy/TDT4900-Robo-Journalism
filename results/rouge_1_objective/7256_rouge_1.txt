pommie mbangwa , a former zimbabwean paceman , was left to pick the flying shrapnel out of his shirt during the second last over of australia 's record breaking innings .
the all-rounder was one of a number of australian batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including glenn maxwell 92 and mitchell marsh who hit 83 .
mbangwa mbangwa and pommie mbangwa were left at mitchell johnson 's damaging shot to absolute perfection when he belted it back over the head of zimbabwean seamer tinashe panyangara and straight towards commentators neil manthorp and pommie panyangara .
the window was the same one west indian chris gayle hit two years ago .
