devon and cornwall police were mocked on twitter for this online campaign poster .
the image was supposed to promote a campaign to stop drunk and violent people entering pubs and clubs .
twitter users quickly pointed out that the logo looked more like police brutality - claiming it appeared to show a riot officer with a riot stick hitting a victim .
police replied that it was ` meant to show one drunk person attacking another , which often happens when drinkers go overboard ' the image can be downloaded from a number of clip-art websites , including pubzi and clker , by searching for the term ` police brutality '
