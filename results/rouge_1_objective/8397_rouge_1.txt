beers of different flavours would have been brewed from malted barley and fermented with an alcoholic content of around 5 per cent - much the same as a modern day beer .
a team of archaeologists are toasting their latest find - a ` microbrewery ' dating back some 3,500 years .
the discovery was found at one end of a 50 metre square courtyard with a plastered floor .
