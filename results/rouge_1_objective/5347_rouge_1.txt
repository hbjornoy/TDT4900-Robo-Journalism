the raiders were foiled by a brave employee who barricaded the door to the premises , and they proceeded to flee on a motorbike .
one of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at uncle jewellers and pawn brokers .
a passer-by captured photographs of the two criminals , and police have now appealed for the public to help them identify the offenders .
