the seaside town was mistakenly pictured in a radio times travel promotion this week , which showed a photo of local attraction , bennetts water gardens , instead of the pond in giverny , france where he painted his famous water lilies .
the family-run centre on the south west coast looks very similar to the garden where monet lived and worked and to which the radio times is advertising seven-day trips for # 699 per person .
in 2008 , one of the paintings sold for nearly # 41 million at auction in london .
