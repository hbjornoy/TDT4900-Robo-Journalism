the report from the charity 4children - which will be launched by deputy prime minister nick clegg on wednesday - reveals that parents were more optimistic at the height of the recession .
more people believe family life is harder now than 20 years ago - and middle-class parents are more anxious about their children 's future than even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds .
the study found 42 per cent of people with average or above-average incomes were pessimistic about the chances of their children in life - and just 22 per cent were optimistic .
