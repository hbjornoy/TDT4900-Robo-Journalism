izzy imset , a local dive shop operator at chesil beach in dorset , found this collection washed up on the shore of britain and northern europe for the last two years .
some theorists believe the pieces could date back to the titanic - and may have risen to the water 's surface after being contained for more than a century in the lost wreckage of the ship - which sunk in april 1912 .
the pieces are made from gutta percha , a form of latex made from the sap of a tropical tree of the same name .
