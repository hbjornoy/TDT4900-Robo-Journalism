ms bishop supposedly confronted tony abbott this week after reading media reports that a male colleague would ` chaperone ' her to the united nations climate change conference next week .
the foreign minister was not consulted about mr robb shadowing her and is said to have confronted him over the matter as well .
mr robb , who is below ms bishop in the cabinet ranks , was being sent to peru to ensure australia was n't over-committing on its climate change policy promises .
ms bishop 's office would not be drawn on the exchange with mr abbott .
