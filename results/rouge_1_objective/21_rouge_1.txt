queen anne founded the royal ascot in 1711 , the monarch , accompanied by prince philip in the horse-drawn royal carriage .
the queen , whose choice of hat colour is always the subject of frenzied bets , looked immaculate as ever in a powder blue dress and coat by stewart parvin .
the colour would have come to no surprise to royal fashion watchers .
