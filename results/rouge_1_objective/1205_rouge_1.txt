the footprints belong to herds of duck-billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs , which thrived in the ancient high-latitude , polar ecosystem in the late cretaceous period between 100 and 66 million years ago .
they roamed the area in large groups with babies travelling alongside much larger adults .
the footprints were found by three palaeontologists in 2007 , when the upper cretaceous cantwell formation in the alaska range of denali had not been explored .
