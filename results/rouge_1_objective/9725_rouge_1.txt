anthony braddon , 55 , says the ` herr kutz ' salon in the computer game is an exact replica of his family-run business .
he says the shop in the game has the same name , windows , frontage , interior and sign as his own shop .
mr braddon says he consulted lawyers over alleged trademark infringement - but his three grown-up sons showed him the game on their xbox .
