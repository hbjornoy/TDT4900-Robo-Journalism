francis ` frank ' archibald , 57 , is likely the next spy chosen to head the central intelligence agency 's national clandestine service .
the government is remaining mum , but francis archibald is likely to go to one of the agency 's highest-ranking women .
the top cia spy was leaked on twitter wednesday , though he remains undercover as the agency chief in latin america .
the leak was likely related to a report tuesday that the post would be filled by the head of the cia 's latin american division .
