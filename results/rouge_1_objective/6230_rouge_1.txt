florida-based freedom ship is set to cost $ 10 billion and weigh 2.7 million tonnes - making it too large to ever dock .
the ship would spend the whole time at sea , circling the globe once every two years , powered by solar and wave energy .
there 's only a couple of hitches - it 's not built yet , and it 's going to look an awful lot like a multi-storey carpark when it is .
