the video was filmed in aleppo and shows a man believed to be named ahmed muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners , who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range .
muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring nato member state turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in syria .
the film is reminiscent of the gruesome video showing the burning to death of jordanian pilot muath al-kaseasbeh .
