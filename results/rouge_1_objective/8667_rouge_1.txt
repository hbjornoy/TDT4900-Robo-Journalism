the sierra leone-flagged , a 50 year old ship designed to transport cattle - was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern italian coast .
it had been put on a collision course for the italian coast but ran out of fuel , officials said .
it is believed to have set sail from turkey , although the migrants were victims of smugglers using an alternative route to the usual one from libya .
italy 's coastguard tweeted to say the ship had arrived in to port shortly before 10pm gmt .
