survivors have told how beauticians were brought in to put makeup on the women before they were attacked , and said some victims were forced to call their families after to explain what had happened .
survivors of badush prison , in mosul , have said women arriving there are given two choices : convert to islam and be sold off for between $ 25 and $ 150 , or refuse and be subjected to rape and slow death .
the number of women held there could be in the thousands and include christians and turkomens - a largely muslim group closely related to the turks .
