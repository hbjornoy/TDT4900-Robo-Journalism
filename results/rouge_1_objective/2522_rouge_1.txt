new york assemblyman karim camara has introduced a bill that will require health warning labels on certain drinks with added sugar .
it comes after the world health organisation recommended slashing a person 's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day .
a regular can of coke contains 35g of sugar , so that alone would exceed this limit .
