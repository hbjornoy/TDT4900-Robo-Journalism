the ` purefresh ' seat has a hidden fan that sucks in air and pushes it through an odour-eating carbon filter .
the $ 90 -lrb- # 58 -rrb- seat turns on automatically when someone sits down and the built in fan hums quietly as it filters out any nasty smells .
the air flows over a scent pack similar to air fresheners to mask any unwanted odours .
