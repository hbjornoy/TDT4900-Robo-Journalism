more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries , including the uk , canada , japan , germany , russia and the us .
the researchers said they were surprised by the results , believing that the twins ' shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics .
