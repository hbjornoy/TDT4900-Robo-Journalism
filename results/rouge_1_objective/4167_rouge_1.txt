researcher jonas himmelstrand , falling educational standards and a wave of disorder and bullying in schools are directly connected to state subsidies for daycare .
the analysis looked at the situation in mr himmelstrand 's homeland of sweden where more than nine out of ten children spend their early years in nurseries .
he said : ` swedish schools have among the highest truancy , the most damage to property and the most offensive language of all comparable nations .
i would urge policy makers in the uk to rethink their approach to childcare .
