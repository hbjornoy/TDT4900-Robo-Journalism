clay aiken , the openly gay runner-up in the 2003 american idol contest , is quietly exploring a run for congress in his native north carolina republican party .
the washington blade , a gay community magazine in the nation 's capital , reported friday that the crooner has talked with pollsters and election consultants to learn whether he would stand a chance to unseat rep. renee ellmers , the republican who has represented the raleigh , north carolina district since 2011 .
aiken is actively working toward a veteran of tarheel state politics who served under governor bev purdue and worked on former democratic presidential nominee al gore 's campaign in 2000 .
