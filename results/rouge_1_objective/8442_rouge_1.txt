declan clark , 13 , slipped while climbing a tree and a branch pierced his bowel in a neighbour 's garden in rosyth , scotland .
he was rushed to hospital for a three and a half hour operation which saved his life .
he is now fitted with an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers .
the branch shot straight back out of declan 's stomach so none of it was still in his body .
