the 3-year-old boy 's grandmother , kathy griffin , told kmgh ` the supervisor told me -lsb- on the phone -rsb- that it was very disturbing .
so i can only imagine what the footage was ' guardian has said her three-year-old autistic grandson was tied down onto a seat by his bus driver .
griffin is a guardian to the boy , as well as her four-year-old granddaughter .
