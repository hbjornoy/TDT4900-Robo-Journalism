owners of william welsummer , or willy , have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise , after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early .
they say they have never raised any problems with the bird .
the cockerel has been waking neighbours up for three months at 4am and has now been given an asbo .
