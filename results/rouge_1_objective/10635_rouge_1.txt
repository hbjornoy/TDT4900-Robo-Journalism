turncoat mp douglas carswell is set to humiliate david cameron at the clacton by-election sparked by his defection , a survation poll for the mail on sunday .
the figures -- the first test of public opinion since the politician rocked westminster by defecting to nigel farage 's party -- predict a record 48 point swing towards ukip .
they put the anti-brussels party a staggering 44 percentage points ahead of mr carswell 's former party in the essex constituency .
if the results are repeated in the by-election , the swing would exceed the current record 44 points achieved by lib dem mp simon hughes when he thrashed labour 's peter tatchell .
