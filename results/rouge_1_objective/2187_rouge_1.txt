the queen , who was accompanied by the duke of edinburgh , was greeted by cheering locals as she arrived for a sunday service at the tiny church of st mary magdalene in sandringham .
the queen was elegant in a raspberry pink coat and matching hat , appeared to be in good spirits and beamed broadly as she strode into the church .
sandringham is within walking distance from the quaint building , although the 87-year-old monarch and her husband were driven the short distance in a range rover instead .
