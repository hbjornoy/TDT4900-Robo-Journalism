the brookhaven national laboratory 's realistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- accelerates nuclei to the speed of light , before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma .
one of the world 's most powerful particle accelerators , which is capable of generating particles hotter than four trillion degrees celsius , has come under the spotlight after experts have warned that micro black holes and strange matter could be generated .
the brookhaven will be able to generate collisions 20 times stronger than when it was originally built , prompting legal experts to question whether the facility also needs to perform a more thorough risk assessment .
