philip hammond has questioned david cameron 's desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid .
the foreign secretary said he saw no reason to pass a law that says 0.7 per cent of britain 's national income has to go on aid ` because we have met it already ' mr hammond 's remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for mr cameron 's vow to put the commitment on the statute in this parliament .
