the canadian coast guard ship samuel risley is shown in this aerial photo near whitefish bay on lake superior northwest of sault ste. marie , ontario .
they are carrying a variety of goods from canadian grain to us iron and steel but are being hampered by slabs of ice as big as pick-up trucks .
the icebreaker was participating in an effort to free eight freighters from heavy ice .
the ships ' ability to manoeuvre is extremely limited because the ice is able to penetrate their hulls .
