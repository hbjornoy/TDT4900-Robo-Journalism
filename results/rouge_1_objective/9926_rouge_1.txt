researchers from essex university and the university of oxford have found that minorities living in mixed areas were five per cent likely to identify with being british than those who did n't .
people who lived separately from their own ethnicity were also just as likely to take part in community activities .
the study of 4,391 people , 3,582 of which came from ethnic minorities found that , for white britons , being poor was a bigger factor in breaking down trust between neighbours than race .
