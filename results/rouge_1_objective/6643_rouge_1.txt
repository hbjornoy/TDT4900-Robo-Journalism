authorities say she is one of the women allegedly hired by a laotian wildlife trafficking gang to pose as hunters - who are allowed to kill a limited number of rhinos and keep the horns as trophies - in order to circumvent the law .
authorities and wildlife investigators from several countries have joined forces in an operation aimed at breaking down the animal trading network which connects african wildlife and the asian market .
rhino horn is now worth more than # 37,000 a kilo , fetching more on the black market than diamonds and cocaine , leading to a surge of poaching in south africa to record highs last year .
