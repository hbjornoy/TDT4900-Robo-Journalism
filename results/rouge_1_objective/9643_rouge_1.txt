sportsmail has learned that mccullum told icc anti-corruption investigators a player offered him up to # 107,000 to underperform .
it is thought to be the same player for whom former new zealand test batsman lou vincent admitted fixing matches in both county cricket and in the short-lived indian cricket league .
mccullum 's claim will send further shockwaves through the game , particularly in england as the batsman said his ` hero ' tried to bribe him in a worcester cafe during new zealand 's tour in 2008 .
