the freak summer snowstorm hit parts of wyoming , south dakota , montana and colorado .
children took full advantage of the unseasonably cold weather building snowmen in the local park and amusing themselves by pelting each other with snowballs .
the storm was heaviest on wednesday , ranging from flurries at lower elevations to as much as 10 inches in mountain areas .
the weather has become increasingly unpredictable in the region according to local residents .
