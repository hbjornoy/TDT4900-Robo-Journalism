a group of artists have claimed responsibility for hanging three effigies of lynching victims around the university of california-berkeley campus this weekend .
the artists are from the san francisco bay area - but does not state whether the people behind it are students .
the perpetrators are a ` collective of queer black and -lrb- people of color -rrb- artists , our family 's , our history 's , ' the note says .
the intention was to draw parallels between the 21st century police killings of michael brown and eric gardner and the 20th century lynchings by mobs in the south .
