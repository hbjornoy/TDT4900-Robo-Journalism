children are doing so little physical activity that their lives may be shorter as a result , a parliamentary report found .
half of seven-year-olds do not do any exercise on a regular basis , the report said .
the report called for a government-backed programme to encourage children into sport , outdoor play and walking or cycling , with the aim of encouraging them to carry on with physical activities throughout their lives .
it warned that lack of physical activity is a habit laid down in childhood -- and is responsible for one in five premature deaths .
