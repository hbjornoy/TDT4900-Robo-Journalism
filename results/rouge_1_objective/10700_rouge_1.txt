the picture , taken immediately before the legendary aviator launched her ill-fated attempt to circumnavigate the globe from miami in june 1937 , shows a distinctive patch of aluminum bolted to the side of her lockheed model 10 electra .
the metal plate appears to match a piece of aluminum recovered from a remote pacific island in 1991 - raising the possibility that she perished as a starving castaway having survived a terrifying crash-landing .
the picture which was recovered from the vaults of the miami herald , is the only one in existence to show the apparent aluminum covering .
