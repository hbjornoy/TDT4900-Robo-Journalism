punxsatawny phil made his opinion of bill de blasio quite clear when he leaped from the mayor 's arms and tried to flee a staten island event on sunday .
he dropped the new york version of punxsutawney phil , staten island chuck , as he 's called six more miserable weeks of winter this morning just like his country cousin .
chuck has a rather nasty reputation .
