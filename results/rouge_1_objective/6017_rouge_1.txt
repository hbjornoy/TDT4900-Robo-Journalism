researcher thodoris karapantsios began his experiments by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity .
he was ` fried potatoes ' , greek researchers set about to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity .
greek researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity .
