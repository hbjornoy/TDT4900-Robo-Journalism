new figures show the bill for family members on the public payroll has soared by 50 per cent since the general election to hit almost # 3.8 million .
several cabinet ministers are among almost 170 mps who declare that they have a relative on their staff , with their wages funded by the taxpayer .
mps attacked the ` incendiary ' plan and threatened to get around the ban with a ` wife swap ' arrangement , with spouses switching to work for backbenchers .
in 2010 there were 137 mps employing family members but the figure soared to 167 last year .
