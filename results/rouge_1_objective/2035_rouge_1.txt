scientists have demonstrated a new method of printing graphene-based ink on the flexible instrument .
they believe graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin sensors .
the scientists designed their piano in collaboration with novalia limited and its keys are made from graphene-based inks , which have been printed onto a plastic film .
