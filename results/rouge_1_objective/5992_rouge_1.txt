two voles were captured fighting tooth and nail , tumbling through the ice and snow with their claws at the ready .
it appears one of the voles did not take lightly to the other entering its territory on hokkaido island , japan , and a fight ensued .
the voles appears to scream in pain , as the smaller one bites down on its back , taking friendship -lrb- and snowmen -rrb- firmly off the cards .
