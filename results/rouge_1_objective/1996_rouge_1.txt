thousands of australians scored illegal drugs from a website run like ebay , where they could check out reviews on dope , meth , ecstasy and cocaine and order their highs through the post at a quarter of the street price .
a 30-year-old texan man named ross ulbricht is alleged by the fbi to have created the website and to have run it from a bondi apartment in sydney for the first six months , but he has plead not guilty to the charges against him .
the journalist began hanging out on the site 's online forums , which you could access by downloading tor software to your computer and by trading in the online currency bitcoin .
