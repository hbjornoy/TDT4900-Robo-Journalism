dramatic incident was witnessed first hand by a british journalist who was driving through the capital bangui when the truck carrying the peacekeepers swerved in front of his vehicle and pulled up just a few metres away .
some of his comrades take cover while others can be seen and almost instantly one of the men falls in a heap on the ground .
the incident happened shortly after it was announced that two french soldiers had been killed fighting in bangui underscoring the challenges of the french military intervention in the troubled central african republic .
