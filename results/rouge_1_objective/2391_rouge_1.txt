armed with mops , buckets and disinfectant , police took to the manchester streets this weekend to shame drunks who relieved themselves in the street .
revellers spotted urinating in public were handed a warning letter by officers from greater manchester police , before being given the choice of cleaning up their own mess or running the risk of an on-the-spot fine .
the men , aged 22 and 27 , were on the way to the printworks complex of bars and restaurants .
