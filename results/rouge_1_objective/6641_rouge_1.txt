ray green , 52 , from cramlington , northumberland , received # 250 compensation in vouchers from thomas cook after his supposed-to-be peaceful wintersun break to an el gouna resort was ruined by a pool party .
mr green says he was misled by the thomas cook brochure for the resort which offered no warning that regular parties with lasers and loud music , with revellers bused in from around the area .
the bass in the sound system was at such a level it forced a glass to fall off the table of his room .
