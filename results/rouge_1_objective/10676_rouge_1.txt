the uk version of samsung 's flagship phone will arrive on these shores with a only quad-core qualcomm snapdragon 600 cpu , the samsung has admitted .
other markets will benefit from an 1.6 ghz exynos 5 octa-core processor , which is the thought to be the most powerful chip yet squeezed into a mobile phone .
samsung had previously said the s4 's chip would vary between markets , but it was understood the uk would be one of those where the eight-core processor would be available .
