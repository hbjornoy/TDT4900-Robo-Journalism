the ` transparent tape ' is the work of chinese designers at nanoin design who wanted to create a simple solution to this sticky problem .
the tape works by having non-adhesive edges so that its easy to find the end of the roll by running a finger around it .
the transparent tape won the red dot design award 2013 for designers gao fenglin , huang xiaofei , zhou buyi , zhou xiaofei .
the team are now looking for a production partner .
