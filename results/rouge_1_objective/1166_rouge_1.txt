amazon and la areas will be able to select sunday as a delivery day at the checkout .
amazon will be rolled out to other cities including dallas and new orleans next year .
amazon says it is planning to extend the year-round service next year to all its customers after striking a deal with the us postal service -lrb- usps -rrb- .
the deal is the first of its kind in the us and poses a challenge to other retailers like google and ebay who are developing their own same-day service .
