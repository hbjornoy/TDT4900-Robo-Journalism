david cameron 's flagship school building programme is way off track , labour claimed more than half of schools promised rebuilds from this government are still waiting for work to start three years and five months after the programme was first launched .
only 14 school buildings have been handed over for use under mr cameron 's priority school building .
the conservatives hit back - denying the scheme was behind schedule , and pointing out that it was managing to build schools a third cheaper than under labour .
