tulip siddiq , a former aide to ed miliband , is accused of failing to tell voters that she met vladimir putin in moscow two years ago when a controversial billion-dollar arms deal was signed .
the tories last night accused ms siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to putin and sheikh hasina .
they claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in january 2013 -- just six months before she won a hotly-contested labour selection contest in hampstead -- and her links with hasina .
labour mp glenda jackson won hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010 .
