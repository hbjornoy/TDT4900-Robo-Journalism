victor valdes is expected to make his manchester united debut in the less-than-glamorous surroundings of cambridge united 's abbey stadium on friday night .
the former barcelona keeper has been named on the bench for united 's premier league matches at qpr and at home to southampton behind david de gea .
valdes , 33 , signed an 18-month contract at old trafford earlier this month .
