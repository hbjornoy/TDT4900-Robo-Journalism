brian north , mbe , died when he lost control of his replica first world war biplane and plummeted into a field .
he had been flying it for about a month before the crash around a mile from front range airport near denver .
he then made a series of right turns until he was approaching the control tower again and in a garbled transmission requested a ` full-stop ' landing .
the plane then plummeted to the ground and burst into flames about a mile north of the runway .
