the incredible sounds are the work of ice music , a swedish orchestra from the town of lule√• , who have taken the concept of being ` cool ' to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur tim leonhard .
mr linhart said he creates the ` icestruments ' by hand before adding strings , fret boards and other parts to his designs .
the songs are performed inside an igloo-like concert hall , which is also covered in ice , and seats around 170 people .
