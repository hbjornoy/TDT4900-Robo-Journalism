recycled car tyres could soon be used to surface roads across the country after a pioneering trial found they made roads quieter .
one of the busiest roads in scotland was resurfaced last year with the asphalt , containing shredded rubber from old tyres .
experts claim the road requires less maintenance and still allows for drainage , while tyre recyclers claim the technique will also save money because the new material is thinner than standard roads .
