alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas found butch , a homeless and dying boston terrier .
he was left to live in the streets , al.com through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal .
he lived off scraps and found shelter from the frost , but a week before he was put to sleep .
the dog , who had a swollen heart , experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life .
the vet suggested he was scheduled for a ` humane euthanasia ' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog .
