tim sherwood and chris ramsey may become a united force again in seasons to come .
two english coaches who have come up through the ranks against each other in a match of this importance .
they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top-flight football .
they have been for pints this season and will do so again in the future .
