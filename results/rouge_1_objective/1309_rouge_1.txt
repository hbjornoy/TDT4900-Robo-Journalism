then-12-year-old dennis komsa wrote a note on a piece of paper , put it in a glass mason jar and hurled it into the atlantic ocean near sampson avenue in seaside heights , new jersey .
the bottle was found by norman stanton about a week after hurricane sandy devastated the new jersey coast - he was picking through some debris outside his sister 's home .
komsa tossed his message in a bottle into a back yard a quarter of a mile from where komsa had thrown it in .
