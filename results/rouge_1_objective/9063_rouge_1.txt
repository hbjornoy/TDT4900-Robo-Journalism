gary neville and jamie carragher slammed kevin mirallas after the everton midfielder refused to let leighton baines take a penalty against west brom , only for the belgian to then miss .
the belgian stepped up to take the penalty as a ` despicable breach of team orders ' it proved to be mirallas and team-mates romelu lukaku and steven naismith , who both tried to reason with the belgian , before firing his effort from 12 yards wide via the base of the left-hand post .
everton boss roberto martinez did not look overly impressed from the sidelines by mirallas ' penalty .
