genetic research has revealed that ancient european populations were dark skinned for far longer than had originally been thought .
the first europeans looked dramatically different to most of the fair skinned people that brought lighter skin colour and taller body shapes .
it was not until 7,800 years ago , when the first farmers migrated from the near east through turkey that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared .
the research was presented at the 84th annual meeting of the american association of physical anthropologists .
