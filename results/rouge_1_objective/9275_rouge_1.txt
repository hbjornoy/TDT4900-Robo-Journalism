the allegation was published in a letter on the website of the solebury school , located an hour north of philadelphia , which in recent months has been conducting investigations into a number of abuse allegations against teachers spanning multiple decades .
thomas wilschutz , who currently heads the school , wrote that he is ` now ready to confirm ' that a co-founder , robert shaw , had sexual relations with a student in the 1970s , when he was in his mid-20s and she was 14 , according to the philadelphia inquirer .
the student claims she was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a solebury teacher in the 2000s .
