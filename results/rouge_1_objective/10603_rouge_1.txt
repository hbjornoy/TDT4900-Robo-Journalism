colombian women 's cycling team were meant to be showing the world what they were made of as they posed in their new kit this week .
the colombian team , which is sponsored by the country 's capital city of bogota , was wearing the outfit to take part in a cycling competition in italy .
they seemed blissfully unaware of the blunder , which left them looking completely exposed at the groin .
the race is held in honour of former italian champion , michela fanini .
