a pod of energetic dolphins has showed surfers how to really ride the waves in byron bay .
their spectacular display was caught on camera at wategos beach by sean o'shea who is a professional artist and photographer .
the dolphins jumped higher than any surfboard would be capable of ever going and many surfers lost their boards halfway through catching a wave as they noticed they were not alone in the water .
