scientists at king 's college london are refining the tight-fitting ` skinsuits ' for testing in space to help astronauts overcome back problems .
the skinsuit is a tailor-made overall with a bi-directional weave specially designed to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet with a similar force to that felt on earth .
the process can cause backache and a fourfold increased chance of slipping a disc .
