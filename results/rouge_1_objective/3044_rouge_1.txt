scientists have invented data storage devices that look like the sticky labels , and transfer files simply by being stuck onto the front of a computer , or other device .
the tiny , paper-thin drives called datastickies are stacked one on top of another , like real post-it notes , and will be sold in a range of different sizes up to 32gb .
the user then sticks them to front of their computer , tv , smartphone or tablet to transfer data via a special adhesive .
