the anti-capitalist protest forcing st paul 's cathedral to close is a ` big charade ' with only one in ten tents occupied overnight , the daily mail can reveal .
it suggests the majority of the 300 ` defiant ' protesters at the cathedral return home or to hotels after dark to sleep in warm beds .
the anti-capitalist camp is almost completely empty during the cold nights .
