tories have opened up a clear lead over labour when voters are forced to choose between the two parties .
some 41 per cent of voters would prefer a conservative government led by david cameron , while only 36 per cent believing they are still the ` nasty party ' they have not yet been convinced by the tories , with 42 per cent favour ed miliband leading a labour administration .
the gap is driven by falling enthusiasm for ed miliband taking power .
