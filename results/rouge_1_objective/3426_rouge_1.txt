leslie neil cunliffe , 63 , will be deported from australia to the uk .
he demanded a one million australian dollar ransom from her family during the may 1999 attack in geelong , near melbourne .
cunliffe posed as a policeman to kidnap a 21-year-old woman , then gagged , blindfolded and bound her to a sound-proofed dungeon where he has spent his entire adult life .
the australian authorities have cancelled his visa on ` character ' grounds under a provision in their immigration act that allows them to expel people convicted of serious offences .
the taxpayer now faces a bill for tens of thousands of pounds to provide cunliffe with housing and benefits .
