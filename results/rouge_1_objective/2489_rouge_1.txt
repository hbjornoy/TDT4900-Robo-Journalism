french artist benedetto bufalino has utilised the entire vehicle to make way for the animals in his latest project called la voiture de police poulailler√≠ .
the man removed virtually all of the vehicles ' interior features and installed wooden and chicken wire structures to contain the animals .
the parisian bought the disused urban vehicle and gutted its interior apart from a few elements such as the steering wheel .
the artist is trademarked by visually humorous transformations of certain objects - often cars and vans .
