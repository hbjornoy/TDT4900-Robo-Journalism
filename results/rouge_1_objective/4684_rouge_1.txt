simon cowell has installed an electric fence in his back garden to protect yorkshire terriers squiddly and diddly from the threat of a fox attack .
cowell , 54 , bought the puppies last year with his girlfriend lauren silverman , 36 , and named them after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid , called squiddly diddly .
the animals have travelled across the atlantic with them as cowell works on each country 's version of x factor .
