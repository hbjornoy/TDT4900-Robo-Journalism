the jet , which appears to be an su-24 , flew low over the al-gouta area during its bombing run before leaving the area .
the mission is believed to be in response to an earlier attack islamist fighters struck the syrian capital with at least 38 rockets on sunday .
the two unguided bombs caused extensive damage to a number of buildings following the attack yesterday .
