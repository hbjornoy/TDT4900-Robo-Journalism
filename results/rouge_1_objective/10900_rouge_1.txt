judge gareth hawkesworth provoked outrage last week for failing to jail a 14-year-old boy found guilty of raping a girl of four who he was babysitting .
the pervert , a married man from hertfordshire , was convicted of nine charges of indecent assault and gross indecency despite each charge carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years to life .
the judge jailed a 59-year-old man for just five and a half years despite hearing how he had preyed on six girls aged five to 13 from 1974 until 2010 .
