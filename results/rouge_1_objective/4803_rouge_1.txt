mario bassi knew the old methodist chapel near cinderford in gloucestershire .
he is 6ft 6in tall and it was a huge relief to have room above his head for a family sold the victorian chapel to both mario and his wife caroline when they first saw it in 2004 .
he has no training as a designer , mario , who used to be a management consultant and now runs a group of subway sandwich shop franchises .
