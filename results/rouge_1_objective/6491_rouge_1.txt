julien blanc runs a company that claims to teach men to seduce women and make them ` beg ' for sex but will no longer be able to fly in to the uk for a ` bootcamp ' next week .
critics say his methods , such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends , are abusive and controlling .
he was due to run a seminar in britain next week but more than 136,000 people signed a petition for him to be refused a visa and home office ministers have intervened .
