house of commons authorities announced that mps would sit for just 145 days in 2014 .
the total will be a week less than this year , because they will give themselves time off around 18 september .
the change has occurred because the lib dems , who would normally hold their party conference in the third week of september , had to move their gathering so as not to clash with the vote .
