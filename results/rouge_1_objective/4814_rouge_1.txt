nick clegg launched a fresh assault on benefits for better-off pensioners yesterday .
the deputy prime minister indicated he would like to see affluent pensioners lose benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes before the election .
he condemned a climbdown by the department for work and pensions over its bid to stop sending the fuel allowance , which is worth up to # 300 a year , to british pensioners living in warm countries such as spain and greece .
