melissa woods had just dropped her children at school on the gold coast in southeast queensland and was returning home on the m1 motorway when a wrecking ball smashed through her windscreen while she was doing 110 km/h on the motorway .
the ball crashed through the passenger side of the car , where one of her children had been sitting only moments before .
police will use cctv footage that captured the incident , which was taken from a camera on an overpass over the m1 .
melissa woods ' husband , peter , is disappointed that police were disinterested in the case , for the sake of motorists ' safety .
