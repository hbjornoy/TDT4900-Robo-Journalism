dark sunglasses were the order of the day for australia 's triumphant cricket team on monday .
australia 's retiring one-day captain michael clarke said at melbourne 's federation square , when he asked how he felt a day after his team 's crushing seven-wicket win over new zealand in the final .
clarke made his final one-day international appearance at the mcg on sunday .
clarke and australia have yet to name a successor but steve smith , who led the test team against india and enjoyed a fine world cup .
