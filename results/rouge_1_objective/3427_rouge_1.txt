irene lowe , 84 , was left without food or water for five days when she broke her shoulder in a fall at her home in longton , staffordshire , on august 25 .
she was told she could n't eat or drink before surgery but the operation was cancelled five times .
the operation , at the university hospital of north staffordshire , was put off because the specialist consultants due to carry it out were unavailable .
her furious daughter , christine barnes , 52 , has criticised hospital staff who left her feeling like the treatment was ` a joke '
