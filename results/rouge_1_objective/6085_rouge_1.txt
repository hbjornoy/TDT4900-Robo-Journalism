seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the m5 near taunton , somerset , on november 4 , 2011 .
the collision happened at 8.20 pm , just five minutes after a # 3,000 fireworks display concluded only 200ft away at taunton rugby club .
west somerset coroner michael rose said smoke from a nearby firework display did not cause the crash - but it may have added to the poor visibility caused by fog .
