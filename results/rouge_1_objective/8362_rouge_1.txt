angus houston , a retired australian air chief marshal , said it was important that the search continues with ` urgency ' , ahead of a meeting to discuss operations next week .
mr houston made the comments a day after the first official report into the disappeared plane revealed air traffic controllers did not notice mh370 was missing until 17 minutes after it vanished from radar .
the report also showed officials did not dispatch a rescue team until almost four hours later - despite contacting staff in malaysia , hong kong and singapore .
officials from australia , china and malaysia will meet in canberra next week to discuss how the search should take up to a year
