the freezer trawler with an international crew of 132 sank this morning in the sea of okhotsk 205 miles off russia 's kamchatka peninsula .
63 crew members of the dalny vostok were rescued with the sea 's temperature near zero degrees celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- - but a further 15 are still missing .
no official cause for the sinking has been given but the interfax news agency said drifting ice in the chilly pacific waters may have played a role .
the ship was carrying 78 russian nationals from myanmar , ukraine , lithuania and vanuatu .
