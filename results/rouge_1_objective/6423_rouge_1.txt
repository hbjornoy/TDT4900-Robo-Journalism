the albuquerque officer found the valuable prints by late american indian artist al momaday last week during a sweep of a condemned apartment before city officials boarded up the property .
momaday 's paintings depict his native american heritage and are featured in galleries around the us .
the officer put momaday 's name into google and figured out he was an oklahoma-born kiowa painter who died in 1981 .
the apartment was deemed uninhabitable following the discovery of the drug lab .
