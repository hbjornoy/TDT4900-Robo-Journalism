the first scene shows nine massive females , each about two metres high , dancing arond in a circle , while a second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about to fall into a trance .
the petroglyphs are carved in bas-relief in a sheltered grotto at the base of a red-basalt outcrop in tien , west china .
one of her descriptions of the tableau is featured on the website of the center for the study of eurasian nomads , where she is currently executive director .
