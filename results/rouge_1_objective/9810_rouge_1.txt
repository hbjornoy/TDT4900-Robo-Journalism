gelsomina squatriti , 82 , was built by the squatriti family 60 years ago and today their descendants , federico squatriti , 52 , and his 82-year-old mother gelsomina continue the family tradition .
some of the toys have been left to rot in the rome studio , while others are given a new lease of life .
the family business first began restoring delicate items such as ceramic , tortoiseshell and mosaics .
the mother and son team painstakingly restores hundreds of toys - carefully mending the porcelain heads and re-attaching the limbs .
