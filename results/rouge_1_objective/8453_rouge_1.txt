pupils will find out this friday whether they have earned an ice-cream for missing no more than half a day of school since easter .
pupils at west horndon primary school in essex in essex with a 97 per cent attendance record at the end of each half-term are rewarded with membership of ` the 99ers club ' children will need to have attended school for at least 22.5 days in that period .
the scheme was launched as a trial in february - with the first round of ice-creams awarded on the last day of term before easter .
