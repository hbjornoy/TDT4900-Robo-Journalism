lisa williams , 49 , hit taxi driver david coleman three times after finding the 54-year-old brawling with her brother in the street .
the two families had been ` neighbours at war ' since the colemans moved in next door to the williams ' home .
the court heard that william 's sibling jonathan had smeared mud all over the coleman 's front bay windows .
williams admitted striking mr coleman with a hammer , but claimed she was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic .
