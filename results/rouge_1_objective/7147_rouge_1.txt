angus dean , 47 , from east grinstead , sussex , thought using the doll would help get the advert for his old vw golf for an ebay advert .
the model is shown here pointing out rust patches on the wheel arch - the car is 24 years old .
the doll 's owner , a married father-of-three who asked not to be named , said he wanted to make his car advert stand out from the rest .
