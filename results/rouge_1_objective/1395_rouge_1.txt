two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for spanish slugs - an horrific , aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory .
the species , nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives , was first spotted in the uk in 2012 .
dr ian bedford , the expert who first identified the species three years ago , warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters .
