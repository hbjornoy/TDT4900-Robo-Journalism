the headteacher at emerson valley school in milton keynes , buckinghamshire , has warned parents they will face fines of # 60 if their children are a few minutes late for school in a tough new crackdown on discipline .
the parents of a persistent offender face a # 60 fixed penalty , which can be doubled if they fail to pay within 21 days .
two schools have adopted the policy , including emerson school , which was rated inadequate by ofsted inspectors last year .
