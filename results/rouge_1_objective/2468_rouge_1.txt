ann o'sullivan , 69 , visited her gp about a sinus problem only to discover her headaches were actually caused by an aggressive tumour that had been spreading undetected across the left side of her face .
maxillofacial surgeons at st george 's hospital , in tooting , south london , had to remove a large portion of her jaw , her left eye , and numerous teeth to get rid of the cancer .
the technology allowed the team to electronically scan the opposite side of the face to build a 3d profile that surgeons could then replicate .
