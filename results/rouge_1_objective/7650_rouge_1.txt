royal births are traditionally overseen by only her majesty 's incumbent gynaecologist , but the involvement of both men in this case is a sign of the level of concern for the health of the duchess and her unborn child .
the queen 's current surgeon-gynaecologist alan farthing and his predecessor marcus setchell are both at kate 's bedside .
mr farthing , 47 , is the former fiance of murdered television presenter jill dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008 .
