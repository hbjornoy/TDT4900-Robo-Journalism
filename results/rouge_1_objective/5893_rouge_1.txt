stuart pearce is under increasing pressure after a clayton donaldson-inspired birmingham city ensured nottingham forest 's winless run in the championship extended to six matches .
david cotterill 's free-kick gave the visitors the lead before donaldson fired in a brace before half-time .
forest could only muster a last-minute consolation through britt assombalonga , leaving pearce at a loss to explain his side 's woeful recent form .
the 4-0 reverse was the worst result of rowett 's reign at st andrew 's .
