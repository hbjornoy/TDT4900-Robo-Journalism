the unnamed youngster lives in the once-prosperous resort of boscombe in bournemouth , dorset , that is now blighted by problems including drug dealing .
the schoolboy drew the picture and his father handed it to a local newspaper to highlight the anti-social issues facing the town .
the drawing shows a man fighting with a bottle and a knife , a woman with money stuffed in her stocking , and a sad-looking child .
the boy 's drawing shows there is a long way to go , and it depicts a scene that could be witnessed in any large town or city across the country .
