germanwings pilot andreas g√ºnter lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the airbus a320 into the mountain at more than 400mph .
it echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight mh370 - which vanished last march while flying from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board .
the final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by french prosecutors who said lubitz 's sole aim was to ` destroy the plane ' it was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet , killing all 27 passengers and six crew .
