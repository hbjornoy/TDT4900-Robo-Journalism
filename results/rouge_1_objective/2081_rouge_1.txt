the u.s. military has spent $ 34million building a state-of-the-art building on a base in southern afghanistan that no american soldiers will ever use .
american troops are being pulled out of the region , and it will be too expensive for the fledgling afghan army to maintain .
military officials warned that the building was an example of wasteful spending three years ago when the construction began but their warnings went unheeded and the contractors built the expansive two-story facility anyway .
a special inspector general is now looking into why construction on the building went ahead in spite of calls by military officers to save the money .
