police have formed an unprecedented ring of steel around the middleton 's # 5million country mansion to protect prince george and his parents from intruders .
the local council imposed no-stopping regulations on roads near the georgian home where a team of armed royal guards , who accompany kate and william everywhere , are also stationed .
the couple spent a week at bucklebury manor shortly before kate returned to london to give birth , and the cambridges were back last night surrounded by police on the ground and in the air .
experts say the security detail is much larger than when kate and michael middleton has been targets in the past .
