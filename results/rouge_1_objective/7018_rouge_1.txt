vyacheslav mischenko , 48 , photographed the snail resting on a leaf in a forest near his home city of berdychiv , ukraine .
the beautiful images capture the creature below a dew-covered flower , suggesting that it is not as fond of the rain as most snails , who normally flourish in damp conditions .
the photographer said the pictures are similar to monet 's woman with a parasol .
