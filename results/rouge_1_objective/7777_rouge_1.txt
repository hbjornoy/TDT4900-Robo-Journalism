the reptile was allegedly spotted by a bus driver underneath a bridge which runs over the river avon in bedminster .
it was reportedly seen lurking in the river which is around 500ft away from a nursery and 1,000 ft away from secondary school .
the senior officer then told a follower there was ` no need to stay indoors ' but advised her not to go water-skiing along the river .
nick gargan , the chief constable of avon and somerset police , first raised the alarm when he was reported to be on the run in bristol city centre .
