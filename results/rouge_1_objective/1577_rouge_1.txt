the 40-second-video recorded by haim kaplan at the ngorongoro conservation area in tanzania , shows the driver of a supply truck standing next to his vehicle as a group of baboons approach .
the driver makes an attempt to scare the baboons away but is forced to retreat as one makes a lunge at him and another jumps into the back of the truck .
the man remains good humoured throughout the 40-second-clip as another man comes around to survey the situation .
