daniel , 28 , asked several women on okcupid if they have ` ever been offered money ' before naming prices and urging them to consider the offer .
none of the women reported the messages to police , as the messages are not considered illegal in australia .
daniel , who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja , has since deleted the offending okcupid account .
