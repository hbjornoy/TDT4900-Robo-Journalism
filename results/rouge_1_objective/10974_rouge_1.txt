joachim low , the coach of germany , took a leaf out of sir alex ferguson 's book of football management when he appealed for marco rodriguez to referee and ` clamp down on things ' in the world cup semi-final .
rodriguez is another referee who was known as a strict disciplinarian before this competition .
low has not been impressed with the brutality of some of the tackles .
