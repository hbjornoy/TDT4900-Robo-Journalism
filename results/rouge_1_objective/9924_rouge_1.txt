the 40-foot box - which contains 14 tonnes of cigarettes - was washed off of a tanker along with 516 others during a fierce storm in the bay of biscay earlier this month .
it is thought the danish container which landed at seaton , devon , could be the first of many to wash up on the lyme bay coast in the coming days .
police officers who have cordoned off the beach issued a stern warning to anyone hoping to pick up any free loot .
