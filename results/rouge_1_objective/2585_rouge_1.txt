father-of-two john stoner , 42 , dug up the extremely rare new england coin in a field outside the village of king 's clipstone in nottinghamshire .
the silver threepenny coin is expected to sell for up to # 1million when it is auctioned .
mr stoner , who temporarily mislaid the coin at one point , found it while on an outing with the coil to the soil metal detector club on sunday .
it has been hailed as one of the finest examples of a currency produced in the days of the pilgrim fathers in a land that would become the united states .
