liquid is called shear-thickening fluid -lrb- stf -rrb- , and does not conform to the model of newtonian liquids , such as water , in a ` liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area .
the liquid is known only to moratex and its inventors at the military institute of armament technology in warsaw , but ballistic tests proved its resistance to a wide range of projectiles .
