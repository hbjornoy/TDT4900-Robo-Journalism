relatives of antonio zambrano-montes have called on the services of benjamin crump , a civil rights attorney , saying they want justice after he was killed while running away from officers earlier this month in pasco , washington state .
the death has sparked two weeks of protests in the city along the columbia river in the south eastern part of the state .
mr zambrano-montes , a 35-year-old mexican immigrant and former orchard worker , was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him .
mr crump , who was born in mexico , was shot dead by police .
