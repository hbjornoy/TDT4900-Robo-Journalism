a ` prenup ' law that allows a couple to set the terms of a divorce before they get married has been put forward by the government 's law reform advisers .
under the current law , couples can make pre - and post-nuptial agreements but they are not binding and the parties can not be certain they will be upheld .
they would enable married couples and civil partners to make a binding agreement about how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down .
