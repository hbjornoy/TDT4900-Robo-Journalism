les parisiens and brazil defender thiago silva has lamented his side 's lack of concentration and consistency this season .
les parisiens are third in ligue 1 , four points behind leaders lyon , following a 4-2 win over evian on sunday at the parc des princes .
psg had been tipped to retain the ligue 1 title comfortably this season after last year 's runners-up as monaco sold off key players such as james rodriguez to work within new financial constraints .
