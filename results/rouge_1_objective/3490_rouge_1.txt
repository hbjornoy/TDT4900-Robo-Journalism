jeremy clarkson claims the bbc has put him on his final warning for ` appearing ' to use the n-word in unaired top gear footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again .
the 54-year-old admitted ` not even the angel gabriel ' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy .
he also claimed the corporation had forced him to apologise and he did not use the racist slur in a video less than two days ago .
