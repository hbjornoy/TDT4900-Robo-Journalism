nadhim zahawi , 46 , was a successful entrepreneur before becoming an mp in 2010 .
he was one of 42 tory mps to sign a letter calling for tight controls .
he said the claim was a ` mistake ' as he had not realised there was no separate energy bill for the horse riding business run from his sprawling 31-acre warwickshire estate .
the stratford-upon-avon mp claimed nearly # 6,000 for his energy bills to run a business from his second home .
