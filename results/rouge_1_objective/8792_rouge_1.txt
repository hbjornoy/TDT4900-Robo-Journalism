the axe , which is made from iron and wood and stands nearly 3ft tall , was bought by american investor and climbing enthusiast warren b kanders in april .
the authenticity of the axe has now been doubted by some experts who believe it may not have been used on the mountain by mr mallory after it sold for a whopping # 132,100 .
the axe was described during its sale as ` george mallory 's ice axe from everest 1922 ' , and was advertised as the one he used when rescuing three fellow mountaineers from plummeting to their death .
