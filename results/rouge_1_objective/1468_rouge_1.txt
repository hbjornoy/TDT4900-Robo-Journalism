obama administration defended the communications network called zunzuneo , which drew 40,000 users in cuba in two years .
two senior democrats on congressional and judiciary committees said they knew nothing about the effort , with one of them describing it as ` dumb , dumb ' in congress .
zunzuneo was partly funded by the us agency for international aid and was said to be aimed at young cubans .
the white house has insisted that the creation of its ` cuban twitter ' programme was not a covert operation .
