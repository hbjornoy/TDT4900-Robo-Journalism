the tech company has filed a patent for a pair of headphones that automatically adjust the volume of music if they 're not inserted far enough into the ear .
the company has been criticised in the past for the headphones it sells with iphones and ipods because they ` leak ' music .
the patent was filed earlier this month to the u.s patent and trademark office .
