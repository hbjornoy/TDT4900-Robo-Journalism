sunderland striker connor wickham is considering a move abroad to try and recapture the ` golden boy tag ' that saw him tipped at one time to become the best english striker since wayne rooney .
wickham , still only 21 , was watched by every big club in the premier league including manchester united and chelsea as a teenager at ipswich before joining sunderland at 18 in a deal that could have reached # 8million .
the england under-21 striker has scored 10 goals in 60 games in three seasons for the blackcats and spent time on loan to sheffield wednesday .
