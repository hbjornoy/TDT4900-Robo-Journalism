scientists at the national portrait gallery have found a hint of pink on queen elizabeth i 's cheeks blotted with rouge .
the queen took great care to maintain smooth , pale skin - a sign of wealth and high class .
she painted her face and neck with ceruse , an ointment of white lead and vinegar - to cover the scars left by an attack of smallpox at the age of 29 .
her snow white skin has been taken as a symbol of elizabeth 's strong , unemotional persona .
