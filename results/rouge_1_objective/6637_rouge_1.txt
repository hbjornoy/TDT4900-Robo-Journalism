the privately educated sister of boris johnson has tried being poor for a week for a bbc documentary .
she joined a family in deptford , south-east london , where the budget for food was little more than a # 1 a day .
she said the diet comprised mostly of ` white bread , sugar , and frozen stuff ' , and the realisation soon dawned that poverty and obesity are two sides of the same coin .
