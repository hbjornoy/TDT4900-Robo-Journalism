emma and dylan smith gorged on three mcmuffins each morning before returning for lunch where they would have two chicken wraps each .
the pair , from froome in somerset , were turned away from the rides at butlins for being too fat and not being able to fasten the seatbelts .
emma weighed 22 stone and has dropped to a size 14 , while dylan lost almost seven stone .
