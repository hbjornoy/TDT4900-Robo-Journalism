georgia sen. saxby chambliss , the senior republican member of the senate intelligence committee , says he and california sen. dianne feinstein , his democratic counterpart on the committee , were told they were kept in the dark about saturday 's prisoner swap because the taliban warned that they would kill army sgt. bowe bergdahl if any information about the plan leaked to the public .
the obama administration was planning to kill osama bin laden in his pakistan bedroom in 2011 .
the taliban said he was n't trusted with plans for bergdahl 's release .
