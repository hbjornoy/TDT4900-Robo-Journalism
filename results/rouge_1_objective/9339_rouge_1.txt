san francisco-based start-up is aiming to change this by using its own low-cost satellite to provide the first ever public high-definition video of earth from space .
the footage reveals details down to the metre-scale , such as cars moving on roads and vessels travelling through shipping lanes - all from a satellite positioned 600 kms above the planet .
the u.s. group is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the earth .
