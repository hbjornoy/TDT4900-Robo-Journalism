dolly parton works from nine to five - but she might have to find time to be a pet owner too after she offered to adopt a dog left behind at glastonbury .
the country legend said she would take in the white lurcher if her owner is not found .
the canine was discovered in a tent on tuesday as the cleaning crew began transforming the site back to a working dairy farm .
the dog was taken in by the happy landings animal shelter , which is close to the glastonbury venue at worthy farm in somerset .
