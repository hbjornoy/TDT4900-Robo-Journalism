mary kilby of miamisburg , ohio and kathryn williams of englewood , ohio were sentenced to up to five years of probation in a dayton court on wednesday , avoiding a sentence of 18 months in jail .
their sentence stems from the march 1 , 2011 death of 14-year-old makayla norman , who a coroner said at the time she was the ` worst malnourished child ' his office had to agree to surrender their nursing licenses and will no longer be allowed to practice in ohio .
