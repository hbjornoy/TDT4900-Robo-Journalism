photographer jessica fulford-dobson created skateistan , a non-profit organization that aims to connect youth in afghanistan with education through skateboarding , it should n't have been a surprise that 40 per cent of the program 's students would be girls .
in 2012 , jessica fulford-dobson decided to take pictures of these middle eastern skater girls , and her work was recently on display at a gallery in london .
she said she believes the reason skateboarding has been received so differently in afghanistan than in other countries is precisely because it was new to the region .
40 % of skateistan 's students are female , the girls also have the option of joining a back-to-school program .
