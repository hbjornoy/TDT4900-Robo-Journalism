new york body artist trina merry has spoken about her head-turning technique , painstakingly painting women so they blend in with new york 's landmarks .
the 33-year-old began her inspiring project after moving to new york from san francisco because she wanted to provide a ` reflective view within the landscape ' the models must be painted live on the streets in a process that takes several hours and can attract some unwanted attention .
the law is firmly on her side , as the city of new york allows people to strip off in public for the purposes of artistic expression .
