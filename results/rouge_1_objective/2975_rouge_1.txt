cy tokmakjian , 74 , had his case ended by cuba 's government who called it a demonstration of the fight against bribery , and critics said it was a warning against doing business in the country .
the executive , who is owner of ontario-based tokmakjian group , was serving jail time after his arrest in a 2011 anti-graft drive that swept up cuban officials and foreign business executives from at least five nations .
the case was seen by some as a loose end in the us/cuba deal late last year that led to the release of three cuban intelligence agents in exchange for us contractor alan gross and cia spy rolando sarraff trujillo .
