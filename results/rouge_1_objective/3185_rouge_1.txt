the dock bar & grill in montauk on long island had a sign displayed in the window with a banned list which included ` irish drunks ' along with strollers and cell phones .
the dock covered up the word irish so the sign would read ` no sensitive drunks ' this weekend .
the owner george watson , a former new york city firefighter , bought the bar in 1973 .
