andy erlam will stand as a ` martin bell ' - style anti-corruption independent candidate in his place .
mr erlam led four ordinary voters who defied threats , financial ruin and official apathy to have lutfur rahman unseated from office by an electoral court .
rahman was found guilty of rigging his election for mayor in may 2014 by a systematic campaign to steal votes .
he was banned from office for five years but has many acolytes who are not prevented from standing .
