kelly wilson , 29 , was arrested on july 3 and charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident , making a false statement and misusing 911 .
a connecticut woman slashed her body with a steak knife and choked herself with a metal dog collar before falsely claiming to police that she was raped by a masked intruder - all so her military boyfriend could visit her .
she said he came back a third time with a handgun and broke into the house then sexually assaulted her .
the man forced her to shower for 30 minutes after the rape , presumably to explain the lack of seminal evidence .
