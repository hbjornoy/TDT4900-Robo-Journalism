david gill is to play a bigger part than expected in the hunt for a manager to replace the axed david moyes .
gill , who still represents united at premier league meetings with woodward , will be one of those closely consulted in the selection process .
the former manchester united chief executive ed woodward will be on a much-needed holiday before the world cup .
the search is being led by woodward , rather than the owning glazer family , and the executive vice-chairman recognises that gill 's extensive football knowledge has to be utilised .
