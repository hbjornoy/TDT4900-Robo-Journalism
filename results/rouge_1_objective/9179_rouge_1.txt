st john 's college student lucan battison was suspended by principal paul melloy last month .
the suspension was cleared on the basis that the 16-year-old returned with shorter hair .
mr bates said lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the catholic college three years ago .
the new zealand teenager has landed himself in court after refusing to abide by his school 's rules and cut his curly locks .
