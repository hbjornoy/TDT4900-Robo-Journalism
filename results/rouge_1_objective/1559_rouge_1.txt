prosecutors are pushing for would-be cannibal geoffrey portway , 40 , to be put away for 27 years after he confessed to plotting the heinous crimes .
he will be sentenced next tuesday .
photographs taken by investigators of portway 's worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase leading to a hidden basement room containing a ` child-sized homemade coffin , ' a steel cage , handcuffs and a set of butcher 's knives .
portway pleaded guilty to solicitation to kidnap a child and to a rented house .
