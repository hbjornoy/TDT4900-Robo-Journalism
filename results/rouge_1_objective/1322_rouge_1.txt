former princeton university president william bowen used his sunday commencement speech at haverford college , in suburban philadelphia .
dozens of students demanded he write a letter explaining his reasons for calling in police to disperse a 2011 occupy protest on the ucb campus , and to support payments for protesters harmed by police during the dispersal , birgeneau instead withdrew .
birgeneau is among several commencement speakers who canceled their appearances this spring amid student protests , and bowen 's criticism did not stop there .
