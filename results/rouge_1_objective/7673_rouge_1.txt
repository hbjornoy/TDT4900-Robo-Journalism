aqsa mahmood , a british jihadi bride who travelled to syria earlier this year , advised women thinking of joining extremists in the middle east ` not to be a home wrecker ' in a series of twitter posts this week .
she has been tweeting advice for ` sisters ' in the uk against contacting married men in syria and to get their own militant husbands .
the messages come after a string of threats against the west on the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks .
