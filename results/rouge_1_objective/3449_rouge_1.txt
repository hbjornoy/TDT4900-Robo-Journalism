frank ` perk ' hixon , jr , 55 , is due to be sentenced friday .
hixon , who has been married for 26 years to marguerite lammot lee , wrote in a letter to judge ronnie abrams that his client 's crimes were committed out of love for his illegitimate daughter , and not greed .
hixon 's crimes ` pale in comparison to the pervasive , calculated and economically-driven conduct of defendants such as raj rajaratnam , ' william f. johnson argued .
he pleaded guilty to five counts of securities fraud and one count of making false statements to federal agents for crimes that occurred between october 2011 and january 2013 .
