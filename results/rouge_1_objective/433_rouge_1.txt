wayne sperling , 66 , and lorinda bailey , 35 , were found living in a home littered with cat feces , flies and urine in denver last month .
the couple also had three other children taken away from them in 2006 when they were discovered living in similarly appalling conditions during a welfare check .
police were called to the home after two of the children , then aged two and four , were seen playing in the road and officers found the apartment door open , with only an upstairs neighbor watching them with a sound monitor .
