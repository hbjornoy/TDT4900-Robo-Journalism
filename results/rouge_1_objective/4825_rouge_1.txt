tamerlan tsarnaev and katherine russell were given an islamic blessing in june 2010 as they stood in front of a cluttered desk with a dusty filing cabinet to their side .
it is not clear if their parents attended the 15 minute service which did not end with the bride and groom kissing but instead concluded with a simple handshake from the imam .
tamerlan 's mother zubeidat arranged marriages for his two sisters - but by stage katherine may have had to move a patio chair outside so they could all fit .
it 's unknown whether tsarnaev 's family or ms russell 's family knew about the wedding or approved of it at the time .
