she forgot the first 16 years of her life and did n't recognise her own mother .
the teenager , from brierley hill , west midlands , was 16 when she developed encephalitis , which causes inflammation of the brain .
she has relied on photographs , stories and childhood toys for help .
she is now using pictures to help herself piece together her younger years .
