professor nick curzen said x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients .
the tests , called angiograms , involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart .
the test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but does n't always get it right .
