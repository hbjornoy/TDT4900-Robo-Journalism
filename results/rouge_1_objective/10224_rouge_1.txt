lucas leiva is closing in on a liverpool first-team return to brendan rodgers ' first team .
the 28-year-old limped out of last month 's 0-0 merseyside derby draw with everton after just 16 minutes but is now edging closer to a liverpool side who have not lost with the tenacious brazilian in the side since november 4 .
lucas was also seen passing a ball in a pretty sharp solo work-out at liverpool 's melwood training base .
