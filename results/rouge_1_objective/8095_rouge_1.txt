lorraine gilling , 47 , from rainham in kent , was a big fan of arsenal in more ways than one - tipping the scales at an unhealthy 20st .
she has lost half of her body weight after getting stuck in the turnstiles at manchester united 's old trafford stadium .
she had to haul her hefty frame through the narrow entrance in front of jeering supporters .
she was so embarrassed she spent the first half crying in the toilets .
