edward mcelroy , 76 , and his 70-year old wife brenda were thought to have been walking hand-in-hand when they were hit by a pick-up truck - just 24 hours after they arrived in the us for a last-minute ` fly drive ' holiday .
mr mcelroy , known as ted , and wife , a former customer services advisor , had travelled to west virginia where ` leaf peepers ' were visiting to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in autumn .
a nurse attempted to give first aid to the couple , but both were pronounced dead at the scene having been killed instantly .
