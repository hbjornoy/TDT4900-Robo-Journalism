u.s. researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm caenorhabditis elegans and boosted the creature 's lifespan by a factor of five .
the research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , they said .
two mutations set off a positive feedback in specific tissues that enabled worms to live to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years .
