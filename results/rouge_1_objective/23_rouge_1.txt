residents from masham , in the yorkshire dales , spent months knitting more than 20,000 jerseys in the tour 's signature colours of yellow , green and white with red dots to hang between lamp-posts .
officials worried the metal poles were ` leaning ' under the weight of the wool after it got wet , so residents have forced residents in mashman , yorkshire , to take down bunting they knitted to celebrate the tour de france after claiming it was bending the lamp-posts .
yorkshire county council asked residents to knit woolen jerseys in november last year to hang around nearby villages .
