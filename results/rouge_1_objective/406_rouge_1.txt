australian scott hend edged angelo que in a play-off to clinch his maiden european tour title at the hong kong open .
hend holds the trophy aloft after completing his first win on the european tour at the age of 41 .
que 's fourth-round 66 forced the play-off after an intense back-nine battle , which ended with his birdie on the 18th tying things up with hend at 13 under par .
the australian consoles will be left lamenting the fact that his three bogeys on the day - to hend 's two - and a costly second-round 69 ultimately cost him victory .
