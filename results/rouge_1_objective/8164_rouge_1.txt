pentagon went on to announce wednesday that even more soldiers are being deployed to west africa .
one hundred marines will go to liberia on thursday with helicopters and other transportation to help the military get to locations around the country and help with the ebola fight .
this probably will be a temporary assignment , and the marines will remain until soldiers from the 101st airborne division at fort campbell , kentucky , arrive .
the pentagon press secretary , navy rear adm. john kirby , says the marines are part of a special air-ground task force out of spain .
