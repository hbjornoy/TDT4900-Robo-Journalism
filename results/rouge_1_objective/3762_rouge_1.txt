facebook users in the u.s. will soon be able to see which of their friends are nearby using a new feature that the company launched on thursday .
the friends feature must be turned on by the user , so people should n't expect to broadcast their location unknowingly .
it will use your smartphone 's gps system to tell your facebook friends you are nearby - provided that you both have the new feature turned on .
