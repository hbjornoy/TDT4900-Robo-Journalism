joshua cawley , 22 , died in the arms of his adoptive family from injuries he suffered as a baby 21 years earlier .
he was born a healthy baby boy but developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy , vision problems and epilepsy after a vicious head injury .
joshua 's birth family were charged in 1990 with causing his head injury by throwing him into his cot but a judge in london kicked out the case due to ` evidential differences ' joshua 's adoptive parents blamed joshua 's ` ticking timebomb ' condition on the alleged abuse he suffered .
