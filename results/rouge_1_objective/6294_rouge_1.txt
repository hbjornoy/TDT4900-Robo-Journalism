leeds owner massimo cellino has claimed he was forced into the sale of leading goalscorer ross mccormack to fulham because the scotland international had ` disrespected ' him .
fulham completed the deal for an undisclosed fee , understood to be # 11million , for the leeds captain late on monday night .
cellino has signed a four-year contract at leeds ' sky bet championship rivals fulham with the option of a further year .
the deal may still anger some leeds fans who had been hoping mccormack would spearhead their club 's promotion challenge next season .
