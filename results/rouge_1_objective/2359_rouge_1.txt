annual dayton air show in ohio has featured a re-enactment of the bombing of the japanese city - in august 1945 - for more than 30 years .
a b-29 bomber has been used to represent the ` enola gay ' that dropped the first nuclear bomb on the city of hiroshima in august .
critics said the re-enactment was meant to highlight an historic event that helped end the war and save lives that would have been lost if it had been prolonged .
