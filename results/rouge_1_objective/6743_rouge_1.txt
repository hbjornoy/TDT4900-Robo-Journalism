manchester united have picked up just one point in their opening two games of the season against swansea city and sunderland .
manchester united 's robin van persie failed to find a way of breaking down sunderland 's defence .
the dutchman , who said he felt ` good ' after playing his first game since holland 's third-place play-off match against brazil , believes louis van gaal 's side will regain their form in the next few weeks .
van persie has backed compatriot van gaal to turn manchester united into a major premier league force once again .
