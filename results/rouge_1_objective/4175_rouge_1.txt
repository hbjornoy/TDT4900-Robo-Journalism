kelly rutherford , 46 , claims her children were illegally deported to france when a california court awarded custody to her ex-husband daniel giersch , 40 , and she pleaded for the order to be reversed .
the case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids , son hermes , and daughter helena , 5 , to come back to the u.s. from their father 's custody in france .
giersch , who is a german citizen residing in france , was deported from the u.s. over allegations of visa fraud .
