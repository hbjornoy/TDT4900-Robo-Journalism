the impressive digestive feat was captured by indian animal rescuer nitish bambhaniya in the tiny village of billa in the indian state of gujarat .
the photographer and a member of his team dashed 25 miles to the scene on a motorcycle after getting a tip-off from a local in the area - arriving to find the giant snake devouring a nilgai .
many locals wanted to kill the python , fearing that if let go , it would be a risk to children in the neighbouring villages .
