the true-colour images were produced by nasa 's cassini spacecraft , which has been circling saturn for the last eight years .
titan is one of the most earth-like bodies in the solar system and , even if it is ` just ' a moon , it is bigger than the planet mercury .
the images also capture the changing hues of saturn 's northern and southern hemispheres as they pass from one season to the next .
