david coburn , who was elected as an mep last year , is today facing calls to resign after he compared the country 's only muslim minister to the convicted terrorist abu hamza .
he has written to party leader nigel farage to call for mr coburn to be expelled and is also planning to complain to the eu ombudsman and european parliament president martin schulz .
the row comes in the same week that mr farage was embroiled in a racism row , after he suggested most of britain 's race relations laws should be scrapped .
the hate cleric was convicted last may of multiple charges , including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terrorism training camp
