experts claim to have unravelled the evolutionary changes needed for ancient lobe-finned fish to turn underwater pectoral fins into strong , bony structures and toes .
the experts claim that certain species of fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists , fingers , ankles , ankles and toes in water or on land .
they were found to cause patterns of activity that were ` nearly indistinguishable from those driven by the mouse genome ' they then put the genes of a fish known as the spotted gar into developing mice .
