survey of 757 parents was carried out by mumsnet , the uk 's largest internet community for parents .
it found that 37 per cent of parents had not told their children how to dial 999 , with 53 per cent claiming they had never even considered teaching them .
nearly half of parents said their children were not mature enough to learn about who to call in an emergency .
the mumsnet website www.999forkids.com is now urging parents to build on their children 's interests in the emergency services and characters like fireman sam to educate them about making an emergency call .
