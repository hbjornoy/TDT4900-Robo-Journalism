the problem was only spotted when ms jones , who moved from leeds to devon in 2011 , began to feel seriously unwell and went to hospital for a scan and chest x-ray .
she claims doctors at st james ' university hospital , in leeds , had left a tube inside her lung which threatened to kill her at any moment if it pierced her liver .
