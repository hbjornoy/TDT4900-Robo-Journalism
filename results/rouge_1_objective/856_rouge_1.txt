the 49-year-old , who was born in qatar , is being treated in an intensive care unit at guy 's and st thomas ' hospital in london .
scientists have likened the infection to sars , which claimed 900 lives worldwide between 2002 and 2003 .
the man , who is in isolation , is receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -lrb- ecmo -rrb- treatment , which delivers oxygen to the blood outside the body when the lungs are not able to .
it is only the second confirmed case of the new illness -- like sars , a type of coronavirus -- anywhere in the world .
