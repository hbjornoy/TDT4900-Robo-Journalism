ivan rakitic and stephane m'bia took post-match shirt swapping to a new level on wednesday night .
croatia 's ivan rakitic will almost certainly lose both players with rakitic signing for barcelona and m'bia returning to parent club qpr .
the pair were left in just their underwear having already swapped shirts on the field .
croatia eased to victory against a poor cameroon side as goals from ivica olic , ivan perisic and a double from mario mandzukic .
