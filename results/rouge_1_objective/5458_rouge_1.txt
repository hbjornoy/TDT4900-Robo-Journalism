the world 's first 3d acoustic cloak was created by u.s. engineers using just a few perforates sheets of plastic and a great deal of number crunching .
the device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there .
a refined version of the technology could one day be used for sonar avoidance and to refine noise in concert halls .
