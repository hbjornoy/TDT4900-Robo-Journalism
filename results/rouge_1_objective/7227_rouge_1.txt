mayak caberet is one of the last vestiges of the gay community in sochi , russia .
the club owner roman kochagov told reuters that on any given night , only a third of his customers are gay men , far fewer than when he opened the club nine years ago .
he says it 's a myth that there 's still a gay community left in sochi .
sochi 's gay scene has been shrinking since russia won the right to host the 2014 winter games .
