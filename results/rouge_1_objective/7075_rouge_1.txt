western powers face growing pressure to step up military action against islamic state militants .
it was only last month that the first image was seen in years of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi , after he walked out of the shadows to deliver a sermon at the great mosque in mosul , iraq 's second largest city .
he is understood to rule the group as it has taken control of parts of northern iraq and syria .
