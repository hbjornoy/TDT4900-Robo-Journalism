vice president joe biden told a group of supporters on monday that ` it 's time to take back america ' so they can get an ` equal share ' that they can send their children to college and purchase homes .
biden and president barack obama dusted off the economic populist message that propelled them to a second term and hit the road on labor day traveling to the union friendly cities of detroit , michigan , and milwaukee , wisconsin , to gin up support for a minimum wage increase .
obama is trying to turn out to vote in november 's federal elections .
