the countess of prince edward looked in good spirits as she arrived at westminster abbey for the queen 's coronation celebrations .
the countess joined the duchess of cambridge and the queen and plumped for a pale frock .
the queen , too , wore a suit made from ivory jacquard - the same colour in which she was crowned 53 years ago .
