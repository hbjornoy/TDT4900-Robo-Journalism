more than 750 foreign criminals , including 11 rapists , are walking the streets after jumping bail .
the total also includes six burglars , 26 robbers , at least two killers and several child abusers and arsonists .
the home office is refusing to identify the criminals by name because to do so would breach their ` right ' to privacy .
the figures were released to the daily mail after a request under the freedom of information act .
