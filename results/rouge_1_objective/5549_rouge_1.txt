traffic had started to build up on the m58 around switch island on merseyside .
one driver in a silver mercedes obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane , where vehicles were merging .
the mercedes driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the mercedes from moving forwards .
the pair can be seen pointing and shouting at each other but despite their argument , neither driver lets up .
the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past .
the incident was captured on a dashcam by a passing motorist and posted to youtube by a user
