hamilton was enjoying some time off in monaco as he took his pagani zonda out for a spin before posting the clip online .
the mercedes driver wrote : ` think you should auction it for a road safety charity after irresponsible behaviour in the video you posted .
the tweet was deleted shortly afterwards , but many of hamilton 's 2.4 million followers had already seen the clip and some were far from impressed .
hamilton believes his zonda can do 0-100kph in his tweet , there is no suggestion that the 29-year-old was breaking any laws during the 15-second clip .
