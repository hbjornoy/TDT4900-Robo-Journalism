the good old-fashioned phone box has been outdated by the ever-increasing demand for smart phones and mobile internet services .
there were almost 40,000 phone booths in use in 2009 , which had dropped by 10,000 last year .
some of the payphones will be converted into wifi hotspots that will temporarily allow all users to access the internet using smartphones and tablets free of charge .
the company will build 8000 of its own hotspots and partner with retail stores and local governments to get two million hotspots around the country .
