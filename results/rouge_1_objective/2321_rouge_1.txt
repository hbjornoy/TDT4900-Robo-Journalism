phil jones could be out of action for between three weeks and a month with a hamstring strain .
jones limped out of england 's euro 2016 qualifier against switzerland in basel on monday night and was immediately sent for scans that revealed the extent of his injury .
he has started running on grass after eight weeks out with ankle ligament damage .
the only good news is that michael carrick is running again and luke shaw is back fit .
