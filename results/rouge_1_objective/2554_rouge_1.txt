poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three-minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value .
there are 21 rooms , all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds .
house is glossy and lavish , but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch , not least because the finish is so good .
