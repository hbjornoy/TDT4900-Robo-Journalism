the disgusting images of a flat in bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted , leaving behind drug paraphernalia , condoms and piles of rubbish .
the state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set to return to the bbc on sunday with a new series .
many will be hoping the series encourages more tourists to the town .
