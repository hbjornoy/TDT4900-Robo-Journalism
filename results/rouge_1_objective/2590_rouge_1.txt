the car manufacturer today opened the doors of its dearborn development center in michigan to show what it takes to get a new vehicle on the road .
ford , which recently completed its 20,000 th crash test since 1954 at dearborn , this afternoon put a 2014 explorer through its paces .
in the blink of an eye , the vehicle rolled down a track and slammed into a barrier at 30 miles an hour , with slow motion cameras and expensive dummies capturing every millisecond .
the company is constantly updating its testing to keep up with changing safety standards .
