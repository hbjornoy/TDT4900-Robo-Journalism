boxer curtis woodhouse was so incensed by the vitriolic comments he received from one twitter user he offered a cash reward for the man 's address and drove to confront him on his doorstep .
the 32-year-old ex-birmingham city and hull city centre , who took up boxing at 26 , lost his english light welterweight crown to shayne singleton on a controversial points decision last week .
he was urged to retire by sheffield-based user jimmyob88 , so woodhouse offered # 1,000 to anyone who could help him find him .
