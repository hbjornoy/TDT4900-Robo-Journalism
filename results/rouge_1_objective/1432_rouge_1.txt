the seattle-based coffee company says it will start bringing back its cake slices in response to customer feedback .
the company had been getting rid of the slices that came in banana , iced lemon and pumpkin flavors for pricier pastries under the la boulange label .
the seattle-based company had previously rid their stores of the sliced cake loaves in favor of upscale la boulange pastries .
the new baked goods , which are warmed up in the starbucks ovens , have so far been rolled out to roughly half of the company 's 11,500 u.s. locations .
