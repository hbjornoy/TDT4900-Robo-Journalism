torture permanently damages a human 's normal perception of discomfort , scientists have warned .
they found the ex-soldiers ' bodies do not recover from immediate pain as people who have not been tortured and that they also feel pain more acutely if it is reoccurring .
a team of scientists studied the long-term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of israeli soldiers 40 years after they were captured .
the soldiers who took part in the study were seized during the 1973 yom kippur war and were subjected to brutal torture in egypt and syria .
