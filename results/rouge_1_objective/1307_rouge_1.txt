sepp blatter has hit back at attacks from fa chairman greg dyke and other european officials .
dyke had told blatter at a meeting of uefa countries on tuesday his claim that racism was behind world cup corruption allegations in the british media congress in sao paulo , brazil .
blatter 's position has been hugely strengthened however after fifa delegates dealt a crushing blow to moves to bring in term limits and age limits for a fifth term .
the fa president michael van praag also told blatter in blunt terms that he should step down from fifa next year .
