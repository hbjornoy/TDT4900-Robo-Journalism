chelsea clinton had a $ 600,000 annual contract with nbc but has recently switched over to a month-to-month arrangement in case her mother runs for president .
the news network would cut ties with the former first daughter if her mother formally announces she will be seeking the presidency , and the month-to-month contract would be an easier way to do that .
her contract was up for renewal or non-renewal this year .
chelsea and her husband marc bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking madison square park in manhattan for $ 10.5 million last spring .
