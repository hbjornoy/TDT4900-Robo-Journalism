a video claims to show the cruel method used to catch tuna that unnecessarily kills hundreds and thousands of sharks , dolphins , turtles and other species every year .
australian consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they eat is caught using this method , unless the tuna brand elects to state it on their label .
greenpeace has warned that the popular ` dolphin friendly ' tag used by many tuna brands is ` meaningless ' because it is not regulated .
