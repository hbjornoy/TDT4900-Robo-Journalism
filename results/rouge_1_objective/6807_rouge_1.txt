former beauty spot in kerry , north wales , has been transformed into a muddy mess after the owner drained the pool of water without planning permission .
the owner says he will press on the pond and is now awaiting a verdict on an application to powys county council 's planning department .
the countryside council for wales and montgomeryshire wildlife trust have both objected to the application on ecological grounds .
