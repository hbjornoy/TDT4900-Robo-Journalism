anonymous letter sent to dr. martin luther king jr. in which he is called a ` filthy abnormal animal ' and urged to kill himself has been made public for the first time in its unredacted form .
the letter , written in 1964 by an fbi deputy posing as a disillusioned civil rights activist , was an attempt by j edgar hoover to unsettle the civil rights leader just days before he received the 1964 nobel peace prize .
the former fbi director hoover feared king so much that he had classified him as ` the most dangerous and effective negro leader in the country '
