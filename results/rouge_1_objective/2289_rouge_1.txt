spokane county sheriff ozzie knezovich says he had to spell out the policy because a deputy he fired for the behavior won his job back last month in arbitration .
kenoyer 's case gave him no choice but forced him to send out a memo making it clear that sex on duty is a breach of the sheriff 's office code of ethics , core values and officer safety .
kenoyer says he did n't want deputy kenoyer to get the message that it was okay to have sex whilst on the job .
