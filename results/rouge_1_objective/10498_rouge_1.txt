coffee chain caffe nero is to remove a poster from its branches that shows three men leering a woman in the street .
the large illustration depicts two of the men lifting their sunglasses to peer at the backside of a lone woman as she spotted the print .
they now concede it may cause offence , and say it will be removed from all stores as soon as possible .
