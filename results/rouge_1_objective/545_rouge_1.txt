bottlenose dolphin has been seen in the water as far as stonebench and elmore west near gloucester .
experts say it is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further .
alexandra farthing , 19 , who shot a video of the dolphin on saturday night , said : ` it was definitely one of the most incredible things i have seen ' alexandra contacted british divers marine life rescue and the rspca but they are not allowed to intervene because the animal is not beached and still swimming freely .
