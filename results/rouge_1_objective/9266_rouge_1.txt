pair of stowaways , aged 29 and 31 , were caught this week after making the 20 mile journey from tangier to southern spain .
the pair were caught a week after a moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the propulsion system of a ferry .
the moroccan man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed , pending being deported back to morocco .
