fanta has gotten rid of a fanta advertisement that referred to the 1940s , the time period in which the drink was first produced in germany .
the advertisement 's voice-over narration said in german '75 years ago , resources for our beloved coke in germany were scarce .
fanta was created by the soda company 's employees , because there were limited supplies available to produce coke .
