houston-based photographer krista steinke had a child , it opened up a whole new dimension to her work .
the new mom decided to recreate versions of nursery rhythms and fairytales that blurred the line between fantasy and reality .
the children in my photographs appear to be in the midst of some kind of mischief , or state of uncertainty .
