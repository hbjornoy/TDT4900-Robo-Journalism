naomi oni , 20 , was targeted by a woman wearing an islamic veil as she returned home from her job at the lingerie store .
she spent almost a month in a specialist burns unit while doctors fought to save her sight and carried out skin grafts to repair the scarring to her face inflicted in the early hours of december 30 last year .
the probe had started to focus on whether miss oni lied about the incident -- triggering angry denials from the 21-year-old .
police also seized her laptop and claims she had looked at websites detailing acid attacks before the incident .
