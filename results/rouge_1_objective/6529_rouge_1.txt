he was found not guilty last month of the attempted murder of louise leggatt , 55 , and also of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent .
he also imposed a restraining order banning him from contact ` directly or indirectly ' with mrs leggatt or any member of her family .
the judge told him it was ` the most serious case of its type ' and that the public expects the highest control of firearms and ammunition .
