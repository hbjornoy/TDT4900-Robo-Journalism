snapchat allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed .
the messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures , with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online .
the new app will be standalone and separate from the main facebook app , before the end of the year .
