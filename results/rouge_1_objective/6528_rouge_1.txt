spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving gibraltar for the mainland yesterday .
officers from the royal gibraltar police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas as spanish authorities ` choked ' the border , causing six-hour traffic jams in the latest escalation in the standoff over the rock .
the move follows a stand-off with the royal navy as they attempted to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the bay of gibraltar last week .
