archaeologists unearthed leftovers of neanderthal feasts , which included pigeon bone , in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of gibraltar .
the discovery was made after an excavation of gorham 's cave where neanderthals are thought to have lived for nearly 100,000 years ago .
many were rock doves , the ancestors of modern feral pigeons , which can be caused when chicken wings twisted to get to the meat .
twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks .
