the overwhelming reaction was sparked after four lycra-clad cyclists were told they could not have brunch at the raffles hotel in perth on sunday .
hotel patrons have expressed their disgust at the clothing that cyclists wear and are calling on the riders to wear looser clothing because their revealing attire puts them off their food .
the hotel insists there was no such ban but just a miscommunication and that the real issue was with the bikes potentially causing a safety hazard along the footpath and encouraged cyclists to lobby the council for more bike racks outside the venue .
