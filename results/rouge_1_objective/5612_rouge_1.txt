lily winfield , 77 , from barnsley , was admitted to barnsley hospital last wednesday .
the mother of seven was discharged on saturday , and was sent home in an ambulance because her daughter , joy stafford , was horrified to find a cannula , which was used for an intravenous drip .
the hospital has since apologised to ms stafford and mrs winfield and has said an investigation has been launched .
