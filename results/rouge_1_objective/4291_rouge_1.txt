eleven-year-old lucy li took her bow at the us women 's open at pinehurst on thursday , resplendent in a stars-and-stripes outfit .
the californian junior , the youngest to play in a us open -- men 's or women 's -- could hardly have got off to a better start , bagging birdies at the first and fifth holes .
li could not continue the fairytale and eventually slid to an eight-over-par 78 that left her some way off the first-round lead .
the 11-year-old is the youngest ever qualifier for the tournament at pinehurst .
