baltimore ravens running back ray rice out of an elevator at an atlantic city casino on saturday .
the video would appear to contradict earlier claims by rice 's attorney that saturday 's incident was just a ` very minor physical altercation ' in the released footage , rice can be seen trying to lift and move a seemingly unconscious palmer out of a casino elevator .
the couple were arrested soon after on assault charges at the revel casino and police say they have separate unreleased footage which proves both parties attacked each other .
