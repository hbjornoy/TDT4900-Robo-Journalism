real 3-bird challenge is the brainchild of sarah bird who runs the black bull restaurant in wakefield , west yorkshire .
the seven-kilogramme meal consists of a turkey crown filled with pork and orange stuffing , a whole chicken , four yorkshire puddings and ten each of new potatoes , roast potatoes and pigs in blankets .
the # 56 challenge is so gargantuan that the restaurant has drawn up a disclaimer warning those with heart conditions or underlying illnesses about the dangers of such a calorific meal .
