floyd brown , a mentally disabled man locked up for 14 years , is to get $ 4.625 million for being falsely imprisoned , while greg taylor , who has an iq of 50 , was held in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of katherine lynch , a retired schoolteacher who was found beaten to death in her home in 1993 .
he will receive $ 7.85 million for wrongly serving 14 years for a murder he did not commit , while floyd brown was held for 17 years .
the payouts come as yet more embarrassment for the agency , which also settled with a man in 2009 after he wrongly spent nine years on death row .
