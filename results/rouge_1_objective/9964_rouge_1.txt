julie bishop 's loyalty to prime minister tony abbott is under question after she released a weak statement where she appeared to be keeping her options open .
mr abbott said he would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support .
she said he and his deputy julie bishop will fight to urge the party room to defeat this particular motion .
mr simpkins , a little-known west australian mp , announced he had moved a motion to topple the prime minister in an email to his liberal colleagues earlier this afternoon .
