nfl sides the jacksonville jaguars and dallas cowboys dug up the wembley pitch less than a week before england 's euro 2016 qualifier against slovenia .
the cowboys beat the jaguars 31-17 in front of a packed crowd but mud was seen flying up on a regular basis as the gridiron stars pounded their way around the turf just six days before hodgson 's men are due to play .
the england manager met wembley executives to voice his worries that his players may be risking injury on that pitch when they face the fifa-ranked no 36 side .
