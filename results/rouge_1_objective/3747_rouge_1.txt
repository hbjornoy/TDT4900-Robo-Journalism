new zealand captain richie mccaw enjoyed a round of golf with his team-mates at east lothian 's gullane golf club on wednesday ahead of saturday 's match against scotland at murrayfield .
mccaw was joined by team-mates beauden barrett , tj perenara and israel dagg and tj perenara .
mccaw 's display was on a golf course instead of a rugby pitch in new zealand 's 51-22 win against scotland last week .
the new zealand quartet will be looking for a similar outcome on saturday when the southern hemisphere giants come to murrayfield .
