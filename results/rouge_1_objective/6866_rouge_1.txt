israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called the bargain that iran reached with the u.s. and the five other world powers ' a historic mistake .
the talks , most of which were held in oman , included sitting down face-to-face with representatives from the regime of hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
netanyahu has long lobbied against the deal because he believes it leaves iran 's military nuclear capabilities largely intact .
