the popular fast-food chain mcdonalds has been dropped from the menu , now costing consumers $ 1.95 instead of $ 1 .
the menu is designed for the australian market , and allowing consumers to take advantage of the idea that finding coins between cushions did have some value .
consumers will no longer be able to purchase their favourite treat - the soft serve cone at 30 cents .
