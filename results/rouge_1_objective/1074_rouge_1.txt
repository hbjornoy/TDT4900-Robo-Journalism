the attack on karachi 's jinnah international airport late on sunday left at least 29 people dead , including 10 terrorists , exposing how pakistan is vulnerable to the militants it nurtured for years in its backyard .
the attack began just before midnight , when 10 gunmen wearing airport security force uniforms and armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades shot their way into the airport 's old terminal .
the assault has destroyed the prospect of peace talks between the pakistani taliban and the government of prime minister nawaz sharif .
