female husky was weak and covered in painful-looking mange when eldad hagar from hope for paws found her in a los angeles garbage dump .
she was left to die on a pile of trash in a junk yard .
miley was so weak she did n't even have the energy to run away as hagar approached her .
she had to sit with her for an hour before she was finally ready to leave with him .
miley lets hagar gently stroke her head - it must be the first time she 's been stroked in months or even years .
