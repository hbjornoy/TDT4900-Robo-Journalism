americans say they 'd rather obama back off and let republicans take the lead in the new congress than the other way around .
the poll supports republican claims that last week 's midterm elections were in fact a referendum on the president - an assessment the white house has forcibly denied both before and after the president 's party was walloped at the ballot box .
americans were demolished in the off-year elections and exit polls showed that a third of voters came out to send the president a message of opposition - compared to just 19 percent who said they were on the ballot this year .
