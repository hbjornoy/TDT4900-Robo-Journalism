apple is set to launch a new ipad mini with a high resolution screen before the end of the year along with a new version of its full sized ipad .
the move is aimed at fending off increasing competition from google , which recently revealed its new nexus 7 tablet .
apple 's current ipad mini has a 7.9-inch 1024x768 resolution screen - this gives the tablet 's screen 163 pixels per inch -lrb- ppi -rrb- .
