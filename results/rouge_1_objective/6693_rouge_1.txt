british medical journal overstated the dangers of taking statins by up to 20 times .
it is feared the bmj articles could discourage patients from taking the life-saving medicines , which are prescribed to millions in the uk .
the journal yesterday blamed internal and external reviewers for failing to pick up the mistakes and pledged an independent investigation to determine whether the articles should be retracted completely .
sir rory , who has led analysis of many statin trials , said side effects affect less than 1 per cent of patients -- compared to the 18 to 20 per cent figure quoted by the bmj .
