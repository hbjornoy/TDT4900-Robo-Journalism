the talented big cats - including tigers , siberian lynx and leopards - produce abstract paintings in their enclosures at big cat rescue sanctuary in tampa , florida .
the finished artworks are then sold in a nearby shop for anywhere between # 30 and # 130 - with profits put back into the sanctuary to pay for caring for the animals .
painting is part of the cats ' enrichment programme , which aims to keep the cats mentally stimulated .
