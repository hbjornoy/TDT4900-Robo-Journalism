the film shows three men tying up the blood-spattered man before whipping him with cables .
the images , taken from a video handed to the mail on sunday in a tripoli refugee camp , will be seen as fresh evidence that those who deposed colonel gaddafi with the help of the west are adopting methods .
the men , one of whom is wearing combat trousers and is armed with a knife , tell the man that ` blood will come from your eyes and nose until you admit what you have done ' the youths in the video were former rebels who refused to surrender their weapons at the end of the civil war in october .
