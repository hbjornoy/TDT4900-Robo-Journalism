maryland lieutenant governor anthony brown received support from first lady michelle obama to become the next governor of maryland .
brown also scored some major victories in the gubernatorial races .
brown 's loss is likely a very hard pill for the state 's current governor , martin o'malley , to swallow , as he will be handing over the keys to a republican for just the second time in 40 years .
the race was one of the closest of the night , with brown eventually conceding just after midnight .
