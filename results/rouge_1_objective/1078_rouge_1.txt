britain will not repeat the ` mistake ' of the 2003 iraq war by sending troops to deal with the uprising by al qaeda-inspired militants .
the deputy prime minister rejected the idea of the uk becoming involved in tackling the islamic state of iraq and the levant group which has already seized iraq 's second biggest city mosul and saddam hussein 's hometown of tikrit .
the group boasted it had full control of kirkuk while its leaders boasted it step up their drive towards the capital baghdad .
