northampton boss jim mallinder believes the tigers will be ` hurting ' ahead of saturday 's showdown at franklin 's gardens .
the 21-20 victory for northampton , which was secured by a late tom wood try , ended leicester 's run of appearing in every premiership final since 2004 .
tigers will arrive in the hotbed of an east midlands derby following back-to-back european champions cup games against french heavyweights toulon .
