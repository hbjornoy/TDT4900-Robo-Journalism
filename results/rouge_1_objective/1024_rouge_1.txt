mistle thrushes are being seen in fewer than half the number of gardens they were spotted in 10 years ago .
the rspb is urging the public to take part in an annual survey to collect information on how mistle thrushes and other garden bird species are faring .
sightings of the mistle thrush are down 28 per cent between 1995 and 2010 .
