four pcsos from huddersfield south neighbourhood policing team wrote and recorded their own version of the carol in a local studio in their spare time over a melodic piano backing track .
the song of pcsos paul simpkins , jon arey , morgan cockroft and chris mcnamara , is the latest gimmick from the nation 's crime-fighters .
it comes as a force in wigan , lancashire , sends christmas cards to serial offenders , urging them to be good over the festive period .
