sexual consent lectures have been included in the fresher 's week itinerary at oxford and cambridge university -lrb- file image -rrb- .
it comes after police dropped an investigation into a former oxford union president who was accused of sexually assaulting a student .
the 21-year-old was released after being held in a police cell for 12 hours without charge , then six weeks later told no further action was going to be taken .
no students will be forced to attend , though organisers say the sessions will be useful as there is a lack of sex education in schools .
