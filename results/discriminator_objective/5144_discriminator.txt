the seaside town was mistakenly pictured in a radio times travel promotion this week , which showed a photo of local attraction , bennetts water gardens , instead of the pond in giverny , france , where he painted the famous masterpieces -lrb- below -rrb- .
the image used to illustrate the trip being offered to readers shows a footbridge that crosses the main lily pond at bennetts water , a former clay pit which gets 20,000 visitors a year .
the cafe has also been renamed the cafe monet in honour of the famous artist .
