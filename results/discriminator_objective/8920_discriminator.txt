melony gallagher , a cat owner from plymouth , slept soundly in bed on christmas eve .
she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of plymouth in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph .
she was left with only one conclusion to draw - that suki had hitched a ride on his sleigh .
