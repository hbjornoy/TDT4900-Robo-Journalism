` water lilies ' monet 's 1907 rendition of his beloved garden in giverny , france , went to an undisclosed asian buyer in new york on tuesday .
the painting , part of clark 's collection since 1930 , has not been publicly exhibited since 1926 and the millionaire herself likely never saw it during her final two decades that she spent in a manhattan hospital .
