bernard hopkins must overcome knockout artist sergey kovalev if he is to reign as world champion at the remarkable age of 50 .
kovalev won his title with a brutal destruction of nathan cleverly last year and the russian made his third successful defence against blake caparello last saturday .
hopkins has never been stopped in his six defeats but kovalev has been taken the distance just twice in 25 fights .
