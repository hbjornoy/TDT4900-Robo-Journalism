officers on horseback and a helicopter with heat-seeking technology on board have been patrolling the perimeter around the 18-acre bucklebury manor estate in berkshire , where the royal trio stayed last night .
the couple spent a week at bucklebury manor shortly before kate returned to london to give birth , and the cambridges were back last night surrounded by police .
experts say the security detail is much larger than when kate and william visited before the birth because of the precious prince now inside .
