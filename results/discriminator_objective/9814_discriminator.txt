harbord wrongly identified the officer as a stripogram , started dancing in front of her and whipped her with a bar towel .
the man , who works as a rigger , was then arrested but refused to believe she was a real officer until they arrived at a police station .
harbord 's mistake echoes the plot of an episode of only fools and horses , dates , broadcast in 1988 , in which del boy mistakes a female police officer for a stripper in the nag 's head pub .
he was told to pay # 85 and a # 15 victim surcharge at peterlee magistrates court .
