england supporters made a mockery of vauxhall 's fans engagement initiative by making goalkeeper joe hart motm on each occasion despite him rarely touching the ball in either euro 2016 qualifier .
the fa/vauxhall view is that a one-off cheeky protest about the san marino mismatch where 63 per cent of the vote went to hart was fair enough but not once but twice and england could change the system .
