barnes breezed into his second consecutive light-flyweight final with a unanimous decision win over uganda 's fazil kaggwa .
but earlier in the day he watched his friend michael conlan scrape through against welshman sean mcgoldrick on a technical decision after sustaining a bad cut over his right eye from an accidental headbutt .
conlan in particular now faces a race against time to be fit for saturday 's bantamweight final against england 's qais ashfaq .
