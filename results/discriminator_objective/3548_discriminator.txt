driver swerved to avoid a car in front of him and the lorry flipped onto its side and the horses , standing in the back of the vehicle , were flung out onto the road .
police were forced to seal off the road completely while they tried to round up the rest of the horses and put them on a new lorry .
police found it extremely difficult to coax the terrified animals back into a lorry .
