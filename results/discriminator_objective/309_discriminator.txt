mother-of-one melissa moyer , 38 , was visiting long-time friend amy stiner , 37 , who was five months pregnant , in machias , maine when the two women went hiking at roque bluff state park but got lost in the midst of a heavy downpour .
moyer called for help as it was getting dark and the friends were no doubt relieved when nearby landowner and member of sunrise search & rescue , wayne hansom , found them and dropped them at stiner 's 2001 blue dodge minivan .
