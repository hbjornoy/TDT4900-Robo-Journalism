the advert featuring the model daughter of mick jagger , part of a campaign by italian fashion house roberto cavalli , has been singled out by followers of a branch of islam , who said it ` cheapens ' and ` degrades ' one of its holiest symbols .
it 's similar to a sign sufis use to refer to allah and representatives of the community have said it is ` heartbreaking ' to see it used to make money .
there are an estimated 500,000 adherents of sufism worldwide and they are demanding the symbol , which they have previously had trademarked , be removed from the adverts .
