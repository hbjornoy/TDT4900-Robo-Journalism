the pilots of a southwest airlines flight that mistakenly landed at the wrong missouri airport were grounded monday , less than a day after they touched down at a small airfield that gave them only half as much room as normal to stop the jet .
no one was hurt , but after the 124 passengers were let off the plane , they noticed the airliner had come dangerously close to the end of the runway , where it could have tumbled down a steep embankment if it had left the pavement .
