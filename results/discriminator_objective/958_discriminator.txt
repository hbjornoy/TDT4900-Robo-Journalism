tariq sabri was carried unconscious from the chinook aircraft and pronounced dead hours later on april 11 , 2003 .
police investigation into sabri 's death comes just days after the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- launched a ` preliminary examination ' into the alleged torture of iraqi prisoners by uk troops .
sabri , an odd-job man , was buried without a post-mortem , making it hard to establish a cause of death .
