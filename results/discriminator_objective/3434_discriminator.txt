twitter user @brandy_snap posted an image showing an 18th-century debtors ' prison .
it features a painting by william hogarth , an artist famous for depicting social decay in the 1700s , with the head of one of wonga 's puppet-like tv advert characters superimposed on a figure .
wonga then called its own legal team ` soulless ' for trying to suppress the image .
