hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes , which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero .
the melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades .
hair is usually lighter than pubic hair , which often has a red tinge , due to the presence of more phaeomelanin pigments .
