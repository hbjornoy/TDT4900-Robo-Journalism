jessica taylor , from rochester , kent , spent four continuous years in hospital .
she was so ill she could n't recognise her family , had to be tube-fed and was unable to move anything other than her head .
jessica told mailonline : ` my life is a world of one room ' she remains so weak she is barely able to sit up and just moving from her bed to a chair requires the use of a hoist .
