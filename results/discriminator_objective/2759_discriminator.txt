adults in child-like bodies temporarily living in a specially-designed virtual environment start to see the world more like they did when they were young , according to spanish scientists .
researchers from the university of barcelona found that participants reacted differently in situations depending on whether they were inhabiting the virtual body of a four-year-old compared to an adult 's body merely scaled down to the same size as a child 's .
the scientists believe their research , published in pnas , could be used to trigger forgotten childhood memories .
