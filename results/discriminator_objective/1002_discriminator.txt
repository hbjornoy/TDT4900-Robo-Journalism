soccer players from el salvador were confused when the wrong national anthem was played instead of theirs ahead of their match against argentina in washington d.c. on saturday .
the stadium switched on ` arrane ashoonagh vannin ' - an anthem belonging to the isle of man , usa today reported .
washington is home to one of the largest salvadoran communities outside of central america and their followers outnumbered the argentine support .
