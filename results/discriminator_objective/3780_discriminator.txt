bbc apologised today after presenter michael buerk criticised the woman raped by ched evans for being drunk when she was attacked .
she had drunk two glasses of wine , four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped , and the jury unanimously agreed she could not have consented to sex with evans in 2012 .
rape charities have reacted furiously to mr buerk 's words and demanded he apologises .
