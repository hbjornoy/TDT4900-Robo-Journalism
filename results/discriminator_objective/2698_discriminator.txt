little barkie was found confused and frightened near the n/a ` an ku sÃª wildlife sanctuary in namibia , where his near-hairless body was at risk from the african winter nights .
barkie are common in large parts of africa but they come into conflict with farmers , because they often dig holes through which livestock can escape into predators ' jaws .
barkie is now recovering well on a healthy foraged diet of termites and other insects .
