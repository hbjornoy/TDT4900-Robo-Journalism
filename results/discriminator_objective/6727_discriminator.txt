national park service late monday confirmed that the large cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in half moon bay , 400 miles northwest of the mojave desert where it was erected , with an attached note asking its finders to contact authorities .
the cross had been encased in a wooden box as a result of a decade-long legal battle over its existence between the vfw and the american civil liberties union .
