one-year-old animal , called dave , was one of nine of the breed found in a shocking state - caked in mud while blinded by their horrendously matted fur .
the dogs were painstakingly shaved and nursed back to healthy by the rspca - with their touching story prompting more than # 4,000 in donations to pay for their care .
