the u.s. military has spent $ 34million building a state-of-the-art building on a base in southern afghanistan that no american soldiers will ever use .
military officials warned that the building was an example of wasteful spending three years ago when the construction began but their warnings went unheeded and the contractors built the expansive two-story facility anyway .
the two-story facility will now likely be demolished because american troops are being pulled out of the region .
