the sculpture - one of 53 life-size gorillas around norwich - was dressed in the queen frontman 's iconic yellow outfit as part of a public art trail in the town .
it was removed today after the mercury phoenix trust , an aids charity set up in memory of the singer who died in 1991 .
the animals have been produced by local artists over the past year and will be auctioned at the end of the 10-week trail on september 7 .
