jurors in san angelo found mark alan norwood guilty of capital murder for the 1986 beating death of christine morton .
morton 's husband , michael , was convicted in her death in 1987 , but he was exonerated and freed in 2011 after new dna testing was done on a bloody bandanna found near the couple 's home .
norwood 's lawyer suggested to jurors that the dna evidence linking his client to the murder was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history .
