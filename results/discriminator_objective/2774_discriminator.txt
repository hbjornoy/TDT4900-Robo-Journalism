fifa president sepp blatter has caused yet another storm by committing the world football body to the multi-million-pound funding of a film that is regarded as little more than a giant vanity project .
it is understood the film has received a lukewarm reaction , cost # 19million to make , of which fifa paid # 16million , although a zurich source claimed it was only half that amount -- but still a huge investment .
blatter is expected to be unopposed when he stands for a fifth term at the annual congress in sao paulo at the start of june .
