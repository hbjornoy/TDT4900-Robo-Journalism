maryland lieutenant governor anthony brown received support from first lady michelle obama to become the next governor of maryland .
no victory was a bigger upset than that of larry hogan , the businessman who managed to stump for the candidate just one day before the election .
brown 's loss is likely a very hard pill for the state 's current governor , martin o'malley , to swallow , as he will be handing over the keys to a republican for just the second time in 40 years .
