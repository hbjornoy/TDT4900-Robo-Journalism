one surfer was pictured flying off his board as he tried to take on waves near newquay , cornwall .
one of the pair came perilously close to falling into the chilly english channel when a gust of wind blew him off the ground above brighton beach in east sussex just feet from dangerous breaking waves .
both of the unnamed men wore harnesses connecting them to the huge kite as they frolicked on the otherwise deserted shoreline .
