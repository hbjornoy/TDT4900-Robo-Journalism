cern physicist joe incandela said today that ` it is clear that we are dealing with a higgs boson though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of higgs boson it is .
it is looking like an sm higgs boson , ' said physicist brian petersen of atlas , one of two research teams working in parallel on the higgs project at cern in switzerland .
last july scientists ruled out the finding being a ` super higgs ' that some cosmologists had hoped might open up more exotic secrets of the universe .
