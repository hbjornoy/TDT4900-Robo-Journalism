david alaba and his bayern munich teammates enjoy a milkshake and a juice before their trip to lviv .
alaba , who made his 100th appearance for bayern on saturday , posted a selfie of himself with teammates pepe reina , robert lewandowski , rafinha , dante , franck ribery and mitchell weiser to his twitter page .
ribery is now back to full fitness but shakhtar will be without midfielder bernard for the last 16 tie because he has failed to recover from an ankle injury .
