pommie mbangwa , a former zimbabwean paceman , was left to pick the flying shrapnel out of his shirt during the second last over of australia 's record breaking innings .

the all-rounder was one of a number of australian batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including glenn maxwell 92 and mitchell marsh who hit 83 .
