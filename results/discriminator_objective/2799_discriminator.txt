americans william mcgirt and webb simpson - the 2011 wyndham champion - must have thought they had done enough to head into day two of the final regular event of the pga tour season at least top of the pile , but colombian villegas had other ideas .
villegas started as he meant to go on with a birdie at the 10th - his first hole of the day - and went on to add four more birdies and a brilliant eagle three at the par-five fifth to highlight a flawless opening round .
