robin youngblood was lifted on the first rescue helicopter hours after the landslide in oso last month .
the landslide claimed almost everything that robin youngblood owned , but there was a ray of hope in the form of a woman who was among the first rescued , winched to safety with the only possession she has left ... a painting of a wolf .
ms youngblood is led away to safety by her saviour randy fay , who also saved her wolf painting .
