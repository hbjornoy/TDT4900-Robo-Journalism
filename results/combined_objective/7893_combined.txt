four bombings hit high-profile areas around cairo on friday , including a suicide car bomber who struck the city 's police headquarters , killing six people .
nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks , but they bore the hallmarks of islamic extremists who have increasingly targeted police and the military since the july 3 coup against mohammed morsi .
