john hennigan , 46 , of harlow , essex , was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in february at the magpie pub in bishopsgate , central london .
the antics put him in breach of an asbo imposed in 2005 when a swastika was discovered daubed on the front door of his council house .
hennigan claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink .
