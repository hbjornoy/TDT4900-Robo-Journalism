the egyptian museum in cairo , where the burial mask is kept , is one of the city 's main tourist sites , but in some areas , ancient wooden sarcophagi lay unprotected from the public , while pharaonic burial shrouds mounted on walls crumble behind open glass cases .
three of the museum 's curators reached by telephone gave differing accounts of when the incident occurred last year .
