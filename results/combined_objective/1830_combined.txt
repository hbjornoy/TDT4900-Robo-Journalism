home office minister lynne featherstone said it was right to put dhanuson dharmasena on trial - even though he was acquitted in less than 25 minutes of carrying out fgm on a young woman at whittington hospital in 2012 .
he was accused of illegally stitching the woman after she had given birth -- re-doing the fgm she had as a six year-old in somalia .
