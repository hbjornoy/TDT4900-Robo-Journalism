anthony braddon , 55 , says the ` herr kutz ' salon in the computer game is an exact replica of his family-run business .
he says the shop in the game has the same name , windows , frontage , interior and sign as his own shop .
mr braddon is convinced one of the game 's creators - scottish-based rockstar north - must have seen or used his shop .
