retail giant amazon will be offering sunday delivery from november 17 in new york and la areas but will be rolled out to other cities including dallas and new orleans next year .
amazon says it is planning to extend the year-round service next year to all its customers after striking a deal with the us postal service .
the deal is the first of its kind in the us and poses a challenge to other retailers like google and ebay who are developing their own same-day service .
