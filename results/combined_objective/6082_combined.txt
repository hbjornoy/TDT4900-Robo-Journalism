the billboard , advertising char-grilled steaks , was set on fire at night to create authentic burn marks .
but this russian restaurant went the extra mile to show off their chargrilling process by setting an entire billboard on fire .
passers-by had spent the previous day , in november , bemused by a large photograph of a raw steak , accompanied by no branding or advertising information .
