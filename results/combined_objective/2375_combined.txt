the incredible sounds are the work of ice music , a swedish orchestra from the town of lule√• .
different bands show up to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur tim leonhard .
the songs are performed inside an igloo-like concert hall , which is also covered in ice , and seats around 170 people .
