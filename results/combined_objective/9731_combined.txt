sir elton john was thankfully still standing after a comical fall during the mylan world team tennis event at the royal albert hall .
elton quickly brushed himself off and got back to his feet before watching his team suffer a 22-16 defeat as former british no 1 tim henman rolled back the years with a clinching victory against former us open champion andy roddick .
the team tennis concept has been well-received in asia recently through the newly-launched international tennis premier league .
