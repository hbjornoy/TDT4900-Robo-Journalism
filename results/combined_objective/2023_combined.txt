ryan zinke , who retired in the rank of commander in 2008 after 23 years of service , said on tuesday that obama was guilty of a ` despicable ' attempt to divide veterans and discredit those who , like him , opposed the white house 's policies .
zinke believes obama has claimed too much credit for the success of the osama bin laden raid last year .
