laura rees , 31 , had stocked up on ten 89p jars of hipp baby food at her local tesco branch to feed her toddler lennon .
but a week later she took the lid off one of the organic parsnip , potato and turkey casseroles and was greeted with a patch of mould on the food .
mrs rees has been offered a refund and an apology by tesco .
