the large cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in half moon bay , 400 miles northwest of where it was erected , with an attached note asking its finders to contact authorities .
the national park service confirmed that it was the same mojave memorial cross that went missing in 2010 .
the cross had been resting atop sunrise rock in a national preserve in the mojave desert since 1934 .
