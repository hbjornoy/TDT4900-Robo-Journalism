mario balotelli completed a sensational # 16million move from ac milan to liverpool on monday and becomes brendan rodgers ' ninth summer signing .
balotelli was asked why he always elected for the no 45 - a number he has also donned at inter milan , ac milan and manchester city .
balotelli says he chose 45 because he was joking around that four plus five is the number nine .
