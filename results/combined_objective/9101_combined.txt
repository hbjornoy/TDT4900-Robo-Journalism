cristiano ronaldo touched down in manchester on sunday evening ahead of his much-anticipated return to old trafford - a match that will see the real madrid star go head-to-head with ballon d'or rival lionel messi .
the former manchester united ace will make just his second appearance at his former stomping ground since leaving for madrid in 2009 .
lionel messi takes in tea as a standard looking recovery session begins on his left leg .
