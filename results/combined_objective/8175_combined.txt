ministers were last night accused of breaking promises to reduce plastic bag usage and its devastating impact on the environment by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee .
usage initially dropped by 14 per cent , but the issue was kicked into the long grass by the coalition and in 2011 350million more bags were handed out .
mr cameron responded by issuing an ultimatum to supermarkets ordering them to deliver significant falls in numbers or be forced to by law .
