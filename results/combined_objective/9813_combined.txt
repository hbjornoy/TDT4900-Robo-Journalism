swedish company has implanted microchips in its staff which allows them to use the photocopier , open security doors and even pay for their lunch .
it is hoped that eventually around 700 employees from the epicenter hi tech office block in stockholm may eventually have the chips implanted into the back of their hands .
the chips use radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- and are about the same size as a grain of rice .
