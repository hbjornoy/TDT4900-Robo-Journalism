ponies have grazed the moor since prehistoric times but equine expert peter green says in a report they are fast being outnumbered by unwanted horses dumped on the moor by hard-up owners .
the report was commissioned by conservation groups including the exmoor national park authority and the exmoor pony society .
under his plan the ` excess ' ponies would be processed at eu-approved abattoirs .
