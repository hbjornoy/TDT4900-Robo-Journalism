the u.s. bureau of land management has withdrawn a permit allowing a pro-hunting group to hold a wolf and coyote shooting derby on public land in idaho .
the agency canceled the permit last night , after it was issued nov. 13 to idaho for wildlife that provided use of about 3 million acres of federal land for the three-day event in early january .
the derby would have seen an unlimited number of wolves and other animals killed by hunters .
