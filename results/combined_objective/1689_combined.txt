at least 14 youths have been killed in the capital baghdad in the past three weeks in what appears to be a campaign by shia militants .
the killings have taken place since iraq 's interior ministry drew attention to the ` emo ' subculture last month , labelling it ` satanism ' and ordering the community police force to stamp it out .
