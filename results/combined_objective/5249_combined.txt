the statue of sekhemka , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by northampton borough council for # 15.76 m last year to a mystery buyer abroad .
but the council was accused of committing ` a great act of folly ' by the save sekhemka statue action group , who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas .
the statue , which dates from 2,400 bc , is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife , son and seven offering bearings .
