the canadian town of cape st george got into trouble with the online marketplace yesterday when it posted a listing for a dead whale that washed onto its shores last week .
mayor peter fenwick says the town was informed that it was their responsibility to get rid of the rotting 40-foot sperm whale .
the city is willing to give the whale away for free as long as someone will take responsibility for towing it away .
