fabio borini believes he could forge a good partnership with fellow italian mario balotelli .
balotelli has yet to find his form with just one goal , against bulgarian minnows ludogorets , in eight matches and was dropped for last weekend 's win over west brom .
borini rejected various offers from other premier league clubs to stay at anfield in the summer .
