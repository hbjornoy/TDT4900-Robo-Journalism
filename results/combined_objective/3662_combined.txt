lima scored two opportunist goals to give champions benfica a 2-0 away win over porto in the first portuguese classico of the season on sunday .
the primeira liga leaders went ahead against the run of play in the 36th minute when the porto defence was caught out by a long thrown-in and the ball bounced in front of lima who bundled it over the line from six metres .
