caged chickens lay eggs in a chicken house built decades ago at an egg farm in san diego , california .
farmers have to put fewer hens into each cage or invest in revamped henhouses , passing along the expense to consumers shopping at grocery stores .
california is the nation 's largest consumer of eggs and imports about one-third of its supply .
