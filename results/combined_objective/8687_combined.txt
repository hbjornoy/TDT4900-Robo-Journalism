glenn o'neill and his wife cara have opted to stay away from other people to help their daughter eliza , five , who has the rare metabolism disorder , sanfilippo syndrome .
but they are determined to make sure she does not miss out - recently eliza 's school held a frozen-themed dance , but as the five-year-old could not attend , her family recreated the dance at their home - much to eliza 's delight .
