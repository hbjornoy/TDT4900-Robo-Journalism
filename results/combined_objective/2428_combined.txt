rescuers spent sunday using backhoes and shovels to search for survivors amid the concrete and dust left behind following the collapse of the residential building , which is under construction in canacona , about 44 miles from the state capital of panaji .
authorities suspect dozens more may be trapped under the rubble , but are yet to determine how many workers were on site when the five-story structure crumpled on saturday afternoon .
