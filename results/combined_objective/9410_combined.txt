the coming attractions bridal shop in akron was open on tuesday at 11 a.m. after taking all the measures required to ensure it was ebola free after nurse amber vinson visited there before falling ill .
store 's owner anna younker said vinson did n't even try on dresses there , only her bridesmaids did but people feared shopping there nonetheless .
