this is the newest restaurant from two-michelin star spanish chef paco roncero - spain 's version of experimental chef heston blumenthal - and i am among the first people in the world invited to sample its unusual concept .
the eatery - which seats just 12 people at a time - is part of the brand new hard rock hotel in ibiza .
