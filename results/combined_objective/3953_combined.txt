microsoft 's new xbox one console has improved voice controls that can switch tv channels , for example , tv shows or series , with virtual scores , or physical awards such as coupons and products - although it is expected the plans will be opt-in , and not turned on by default .
microsoft has filed the patent in a bid to launch a system that could see viewers given virtual scores and points to put towards new items .
