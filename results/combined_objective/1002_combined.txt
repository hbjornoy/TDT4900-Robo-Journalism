soccer players were left baffled ahead of their match against argentina in washington d.c. on saturday after the stadium played the wrong national anthem .
rather than pressing play on ` himno nacional de el salvador ' , staff at the stadium switched on ` arrane ashoonagh ' - an anthem belonging to the isle of man , usa today reported .
washington is home to one of the largest salvadoran communities outside of central america and their followers outnumbered the argentine support .
