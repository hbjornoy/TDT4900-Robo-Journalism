neighbours placed a single bunch of flowers at the door of a home where a woman 's granddaughter was mauled to death by a pitbull .
the pet was reported to local authorities five months before the attack .
council chiefs admitted doing nothing to prevent its dangerous behaviour after being phoned by one of the woman 's neighbours .
