the ` misinformed announcement ' near a boarding area apparently stemmed from a police pursuit of an unarmed driver that ended outside terminal 2 .
police responded to an emergency call around 9am reporting that a man may be trying to commit suicide .
the arrest led someone inside the terminal to incorrectly state that there was a ` man with a gun ' on the loose .
