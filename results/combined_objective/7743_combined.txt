trayvon martin 's mother says she 's disappointed that federal prosecutors decided not to charge a neighborhood watch volunteer with a hate crime for killing her son three years ago .
the case sparked a national conversation about race , bias and crime in part because zimmerman , who identifies himself as hispanic , was not immediately arrested after shooting martin , who is black .
the us justice department announced tuesday that it found insufficient evidence to establish that zimmerman willfully deprived martin of his civil rights or killed him because of his race .
