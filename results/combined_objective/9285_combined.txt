members of a ` self-defence ' patrol took over the main square and town hall yesterday in a village near tancitaro , in the western state of michoacan , in a bid to regain control from a drug cartel called the knights templar .
authorities are trying to determine whether the two people who died are vigilantes or knights templar members .
