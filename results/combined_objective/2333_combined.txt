bizarre coincidence happened yesterday in the west london district of hammersmith , home to bbc veteran kate silverton and her sky news rival isabel webster .
ms webster , 32 , said it was a miracle no one was killed in the drama , which ended in the 16-year-old being arrested and another driver being taken to hospital .
