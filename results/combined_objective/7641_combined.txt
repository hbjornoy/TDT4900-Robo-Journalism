martin tatta , 32 , has such a close bond with his favourite primavera that he can coax her into rolling on her back with her legs in the air so he can sit on her tummy .
mr tatta grew up around horses on a ranch in san antonio de areco , a province of buenos aires in argentina , where his parents worked .
