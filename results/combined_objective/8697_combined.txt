andrew biddle , 45 , went sailing with a friend in july off the coast of new jersey - but their pontoon motorboat crashed at 11:30 pm in what seemed like an accident .
despite an 18-hour search by coast guards , there was no sign of biddle - and a few weeks later police claimed the accident was cover so he could flee criminal prosecution for alleged fraud connected to his boating business .
