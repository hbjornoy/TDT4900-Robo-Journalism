bird man was seized at ignacio agramonte international airport in the cuban city of camaguay and was picked up because of the curious bulges in his trousers .
the man bizarrely claimed he was only concealing a pigeon as a gift for his grandson .
but after he was forced to remove his trousers , officers found dozens of ` frightened little finches and hummingbirds ' - some with their beaks sealed shut so they would not be heard singing .
