the ac/dc drummer has been pictured larking around on a guitar in his street .
no one would ever know that the famous drummer is set to appear in court for threatening to kill a man in a few day 's time as he larked around with a mate out the front of his new zealand home .
the legend may not be set to tour with the rest of the band anytime soon .
