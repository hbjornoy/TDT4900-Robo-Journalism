stella birdsall , 48 , ordered a # 3,000 , vacuum-sealed , navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father colin , 72 , but his funeral in knottingley , west yorkshire was halted last thursday .
she said the interment could not go ahead because it breached wakefield council 's policy barring the use of metal caskets .
