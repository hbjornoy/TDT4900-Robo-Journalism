the militant , who has not been identified , reportedly said fighters blasted the boeing 777 out of the sky - killing all 298 people on board - after mistaking it for a ukrainian government cargo plane .
the rebels only realised their mistake when they began searching the crash site for the parachutes of military crew who may have bailed out the aircraft , only to find the bodies of children .
