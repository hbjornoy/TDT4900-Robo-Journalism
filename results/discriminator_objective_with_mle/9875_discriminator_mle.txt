the defence advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- will host a number of meetings in march to discuss how aircraft could work together to find , identify and engage targets with fewer humans controlling them .
the meeting is designed to cut the number of operators needed to control a single unmanned vehicle , allowing one person to operate six simultaneously .
