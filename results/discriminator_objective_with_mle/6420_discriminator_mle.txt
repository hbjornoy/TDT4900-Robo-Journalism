miniature figurines of the evil german dictator , complete with an adjustable right arm to allow youngsters to mimic a nazi salute , were among the sought-after toys used to brainwash children in the third reich .
the toys were discovered as part of two rare collections which sold at auction - one at durham and the second at dudley in the west midlands - for more than # 7,000 .
