paul harbord , 27 , was in a pub in old shotton , county durham , with friends after an all-day drinking session when the officer walked in to investigate their ` rowdy ' behaviour .
the man , who works as a rigger , was then arrested but refused to believe she was a real officer until they arrived at a police station .
harbord 's mistake echoes the plot of an episode of only fools and horses , dates , broadcast in 1988 , in which del boy mistakes a female police officer for a stripper in the nag 's head pub .
