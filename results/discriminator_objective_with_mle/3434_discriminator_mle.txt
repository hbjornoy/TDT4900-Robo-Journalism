twitter user @brandy_snap posted an image showing an 18th-century debtors ' prison .
the image was highlighting widespread anger at the loans company , which offers loans at representative annual interest rates of 5853 per cent .
wonga then called its own legal team ` soulless ' for trying to suppress the image .
