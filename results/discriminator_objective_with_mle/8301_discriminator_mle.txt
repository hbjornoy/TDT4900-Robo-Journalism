maimi rearden , south carolina woman , was the oldest living american when she died wednesday in a georgia hospital .
she was married in 1919 to oacy rearden - the same year that ` shoeless ' joe jackson 's ` black sox ' were embroiled in a sports-gambling hubbub after throwing the world series .
rearden counts 10 surviving children , 10 great grandchildren , one great-great grandchild , six step grandchildren , a host of step great grandchildren and too many nieces , nephews , and friends to count .
