three self-described prostitutes took the stand as character witnesses during the trial , all of whom described vincent george sr. and vincent george jr , their admitted pimps .
the pair showed no emotion aside from slight smiles as they were led back to jail in handcuffs .
the two men , who testified in the courtroom initially cheered the women into their sex business , could face up to 15 years for laundering millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses .
