pupils will find out this friday whether they have earned an ice-cream for missing no more than half a day of school since easter .
but those youngsters who fall short of the benchmark are made to wait indoors while their classmates go to collect their cornets from the van outside .
the scheme was launched as a trial in february - with the first round of ice-creams awarded on the last day of term before easter .
