juanita pineda , 41 , and her son benjamin hernandez , 15 , were on a paper route at around 3.50 am just north of chicago when their ford taurus fell into the 10ft-wide hole last tuesday .
benjamin suffered a fractured spine , nose and jaw and lost his front teeth , but their run of atrocious luck did n't end there .
