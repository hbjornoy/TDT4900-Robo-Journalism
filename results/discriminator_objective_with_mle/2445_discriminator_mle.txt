stephen maxwell murray , who was convicted in 1991 in the preston magistrates court on three counts of indecent assault and one of supplying liquor to a minor , has been working at the melbourne store animasia for at least four years .
it is not illegal for murray to work at the store because there are no laws that stop convicted paedophiles from working in shops with young customers .
