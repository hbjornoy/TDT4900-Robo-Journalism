united airlines flight 863 had to be diverted away from sydney due to debris on the airport 's runway and landed in canberra at 9am on friday following the 15 hour journey from the u.s. because canberra is not an international airport it does not have customs , quarantine or immigration facilities so the travellers were not allowed to disembark or enter the terminal .
