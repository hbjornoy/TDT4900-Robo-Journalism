sam wilson , 25 , was attempting to take it to a recycling centre five miles from his home in bingham , nottinghamshire , to sell for scrap .
the 25-year-old drove the car parts so he could sell them individually for more money , claimed he thought he could still legally drive the car on public roads as it had a valid mot certificate .
he was ordered to pay # 120 costs and given three penalty points on his licence .
