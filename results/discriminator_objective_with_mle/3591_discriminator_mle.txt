david walters had become delirious after developing a temperature .
he was taken into a&e at the princess of wales in bridgend , south wales .
but he stayed on a trolley waiting for a bed at the scandal-hit hospital for another 34 hours .
his story comes as it emerged just 90.2 per cent of patients in england were seen within four hours between october and december last year - short of the 95 per cent target .
it marks the worst performance in a&e since the target was set in 2004 .
