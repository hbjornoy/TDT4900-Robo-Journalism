prime minister nawaz sharif lifted the moratorium on december 17 , a day after pakistani taliban gunmen attacked a school and killed 134 students and 19 adults .
the killings put pressure the government to do more to tackle the islamist insurgency and the current wave of executions are a continuation of pakistan 's crackdown on the taliban .
