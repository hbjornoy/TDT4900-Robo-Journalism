derby took the first step towards easing the pain of their play-off final defeat to qpr with a hard-earned victory over sky bet championship newcomers rotherham .
the millers were looking good value for a point until a quality finish from republic of ireland midfielder jeff hendrick floored them eight minutes from the end .
derby went into the game with nine of the team that started the opening game of last season and one of those men , johnny russell , made a surging run in the first 30 seconds that took him into the rotherham penalty area before the ball was scrabbled clear .
