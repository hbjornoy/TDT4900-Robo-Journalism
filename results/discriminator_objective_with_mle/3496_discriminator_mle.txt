belgiam artist wim delvoye moved to china in 2004 and set up an art farm tattooing his creations onto living pigs .
mr delvoye kept around 20 pigs that were tattooed based on his designs by a team of chinese experts in anaesthesia and tattooing .
but animal rights campaigners complained that the pigs were suffering unnecessarily and being abused for improper commercial profit .
