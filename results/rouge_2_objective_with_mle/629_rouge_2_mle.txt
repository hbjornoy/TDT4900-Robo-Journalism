three architectural firms have been commissioned by transport for london to come up with proposals for ` heathrow city ' which include new park land , a scientific research centre and a factory for self-made property to make it easier for people to build their own homes .
one of the three designs could be put in place if heathrow is replaced by a new thames estuary airport .
