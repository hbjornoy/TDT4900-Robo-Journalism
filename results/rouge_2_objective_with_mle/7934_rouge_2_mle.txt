brighton failed to persuade sami hyypia to make a u-turn on his decision to quit as manager of brighton & hove albion .
uwe rosler , who was sacked by wigan athletic last month , heads the championship club 's shortlist for hyypia 's replacement with tim sherwood and tony pulis also on their wishlist .
the club will offer no further comment at this stage .
