prime minister tony abbott reportedly scheduled a last-minute visit to a cancer research centre so he could ` justify ' charging australian taxpayers for a fundraising trip to melbourne to attend a private function .
mr abbott was an hour late to a meeting of liberal and national mps on tuesday .
the private function held on monday night was a fundraiser for the liberal party .
