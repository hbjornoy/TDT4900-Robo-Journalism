russia and qatar have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 world cups after the world governing body 's ethics committee launched a scathing attack over its doomed bid for the 2018 event .
the verdict by fifa ethics judge hans-joachim eckert on the investigation into the murky world cup bids concludes that qatar and russia did not do anything that warranted stripping them of the tournament .
he also criticised england for a $ 55,000 -lrb- # 35,000 -rrb- sponsorship of a gala dinner , but let qatar off lightly for a similar $ 1.8 million deal .
