president obama said monday it would be the ` height of irresponsibility ' for lawmakers to cause a new economic crisis just five years after the near-collapse of the nation 's financial system .
the white house used the anniversary to lay out the president 's markers for upcoming fiscal fights with congress over funding the government .
some of those republicans say they will vote to extend current spending levels or to increase the debt ceiling only if obama delays putting in place his health care law .
