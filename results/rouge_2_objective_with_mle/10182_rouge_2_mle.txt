jules ferry will offer beds , showers , food and power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach britain from the port .
the jules ferry camp was built on the site of a former children 's summer camp using a # 3million eu grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from british taxpayers .
critics of the centre have compared it to the notorious sangatte camp which became a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed down in 2002 .
