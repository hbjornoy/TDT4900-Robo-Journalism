rape charities and bbc listeners have complained after michael buerk criticised the woman raped by ched evans for being drunk when she was attacked .
the woman , now 22 , deserved no ` credit ' because she ` could barely stand ' on the night she was raped , and the jury unanimously agreed she could not have consented to sex with evans in 2012 .
