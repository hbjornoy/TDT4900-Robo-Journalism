former nursing sister joanna toner , 52 , of tiverton , devon , had written letters to ex-presenter bill giles and she was charged with harassment - something for which she had previously been jailed .
but the mother-of-two failed to turn up to court and police discovered her dead on her bed three days later when they went round to her barricaded home .
she was jailed for 30 months over her nine year-long obsession that mr giles was her father .
