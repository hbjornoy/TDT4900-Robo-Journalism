greg davies , owner of cwmfelin boar farm in bridgend , south wales , lost 23 after a break-in last night .
the pack of 23 wild boars which were let loose by burglars during a break in at a farm were quite possibly feeling as happy a pig in the proverbial yesterday .
but the same could not be said of residents of the nearest town , maesteg , near bridgend , who were anxiously awaiting for the beasts to be recaptured - as police warned they may charge anyone who approaches them .
