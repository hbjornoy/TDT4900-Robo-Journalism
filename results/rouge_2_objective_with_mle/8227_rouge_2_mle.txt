mark hughes has impressed as manager of stoke since a torrid spell at the helm of queens park rangers .
hughes , who takes his stoke side to blackburn where his management career began on saturday in the fa cup fifth-round , endured a turbulent spell in charge of free-spending queens park park rangers before being sacked in 2012 after just 11 months in charge .
the stoke boss turned to ferguson , who he played under between 1988-95 at old trafford , and points to a 90 minute chat with the scot that reinvigorated his desire to take charge of a side again .
