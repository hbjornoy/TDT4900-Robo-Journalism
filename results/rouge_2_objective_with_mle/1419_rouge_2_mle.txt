boston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev is likely to blame his ` role model ' dead brother at trial to avoid the death penalty .
dzhokhar tsarnaev , 26 , was later found hiding in a boat parked in a grisly 2011 triple slaying .
his lawyers are likely to pin their hopes - and the bombings themselves - on his older brother , tamerlan : ` he was the eldest one and he , in many ways , was the role model for his sisters and his brother , ' said elmirza khozhugov , the former husband of tamerlan 's sister , ailina .
