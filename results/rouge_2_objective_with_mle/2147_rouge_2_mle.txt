two fossils , dating back 11.6 million years , have been unearthed in northeast spain - and are thought to be the oldest recorded ancestor of the species .
the two sets of jaws and teeth belong to a new genus , kretzoiarctos -lrb- ` bears of kretzoi ' - in honour of paleontologist miklos kretzoi , who had discovered other extinct pandas .
the fossils have the characteristics of a bear adapted to eating tough plant material like bamboo .
