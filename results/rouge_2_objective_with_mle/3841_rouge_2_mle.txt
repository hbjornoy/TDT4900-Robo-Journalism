andrea atzeni will be used ahead of jamie spencer on two-year-olds owned by qatar racing for the remainder of the season in order to familiarise himself with their string ahead of taking over as no 1 jockey next year .
david redvers , racing manager to sheik fahad al thani 's organisation , has confirmed the arrangement , which will also involve handing two-year-old rides where possible to oisin murphy , atzeni 's qatar racing understudy in 2015 .
spencer will continue to be the first choice on the team 's older horses until his retirement .
