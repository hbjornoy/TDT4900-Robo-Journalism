sepp blatter has been criticised over the decision to award the 2022 world cup to qatar .
the under-fire fifa president has shrugged off the increasing pressure to act over allegations of corruption around the bidding process that enabled qatar to secure the world cup .
this was a reference to the inquiry already being carried out by fifa 's own investigator , new york lawyer michael garcia , who is set to complete his report on monday .
blatter is expected to seek a fifth term as president though michel platini may contest the election .
