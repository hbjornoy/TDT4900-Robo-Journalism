the fight is believed to have started after the queen 's six dogs were taken for a walk with the york family 's three norfolk terriers last sunday .
the 11-year-old terrier nearly lost an ear and suffered horrific bites during the fight at balmoral a week ago , according to a source .
the queen owns three corgis , called monty , holly , willow , and three dorgis -- a dachshund and corgi cross -- named cider , candy and vulcan .
it comes just days after another of beatrice 's family dogs , millie , died of natural causes .
