yaya toure was subjected to more racist abuse in the build-up to manchester city 's crucial champions league clash with cska moscow .
toure was targeted on twitter just hours after reactivating his account on monday following a five-month break from social media .
the two teams were forced to play behind closed doors in moscow two weeks ago due to uefa sanctions against cska at the etihad .
