little barkie was found confused and frightened near the n/a ` an ku sÃª wildlife sanctuary in namibia , where his near-hairless body was at risk from the african winter nights .
staff at the reserve near the capital windhoek now take him out for daily walks to accustom him to his environment .
barkie is now recovering well on a healthy foraged diet of termites and other insects .
