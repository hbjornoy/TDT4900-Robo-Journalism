the connecticut state dental commission voted 5-0 wednesday to suspend the license of dr. rashmi patel , who has offices in enfield and torrington , after finding that he did n't properly care for two patients , including a woman who died in february .
patel , 45 , lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted at once .
patel 's license will be suspended until he successfully undergoes a review of his practice by the american association of dental board .
