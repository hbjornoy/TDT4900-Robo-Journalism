south essex college of the arts in london received the most dismal satisfaction ratings in a government survey .
critics say the worst courses , which cost up to # 9,000-a-year in tuition fees , should be axed as they do not offer value for money .
only 28 per cent of the students who responded believed their lecturers were enthusiastic , with just one in five saying they had made the subject interesting .
