architects have worked on the oldest part of the grade-ii listed building , reopening the main entrance and installing a breathtaking giant spiral staircase at its heart .
it was built on the site of a victorian prison in central london , used to hold criminals before they were shipped to australia .
the gallery 's circular balcony , which surrounds the stunning centre of the building , has been closed since the 1920s but has been opened today .
