toronto blue jays pitcher daniel norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of a 1978 volkswagon van outside a wal-mart .
he works out in the carpark , cooks his meals - mostly eggs and stir fries - on a portable stove and likes to go surfing during the day .
he has now pulled up stumps at a wal-mart in suburban florida .
