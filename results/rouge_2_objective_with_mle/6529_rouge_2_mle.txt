brian fraser , 63 , was found not guilty last month of the attempted murder of louise leggatt , 55 , and also of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent .
prosecutors had claimed he shot mrs leggatt as she went to tend her horses at apple pie farm in benenden , kent , after she rejected his efforts to rekindle their romance following the end of their five-year relationship .
at maidstone crown court today , fraser , of shadoxhurst , near ashford , was jailed for eight months for possessing a firearm without a licence .
judge charles byers said fraser will serve up to half his jail term and the remainder on licence .
