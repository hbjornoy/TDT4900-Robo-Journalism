lionel messi did n't cut the figure of a man beign named the world cup 's best player on sunday .
messi seemed a little sheepish , perhaps embarrassed to be told after argentina had lost sunday 's final to germany in extra-time that he would be expected to trudge up the steps at the maracana stadium to collect his golden ball trophy from the presentation balcony .
argentina 's dashing winger arjen robben and fifa boss sepp blatter both registered their shock that he had been voted the outstanding player of the tournament .
