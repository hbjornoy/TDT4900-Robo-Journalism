david jones is passing into foreign hands after shareholders overwhelmingly backed a $ 2.2 billion takeover of the company by south african based woolworths .
south african retailer woolworths holdings will take control of australia 's oldest department store in august , pending court approval , and hopes to significantly improve its performance after years of sliding sales and profits .
the $ 4 offer was a solid outcome for shareholders , being more than 80 cents higher from where david jones was trading prior to the bid and $ 1.50 above where it was a year ago .
