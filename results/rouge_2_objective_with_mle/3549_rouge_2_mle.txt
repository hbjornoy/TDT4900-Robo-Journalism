francisco leon ortiz , who was delivered by c-section at grays harbor community hospital in aberdeen on december 2 , was so large that his dad had to run out and buy new clothes for him because he did n't fit into any newborn clothes they had at the ready .
the hospital has spare clothing to give newborn babies , but the newborn will have to visit another , less rural hospital for further check ups .
