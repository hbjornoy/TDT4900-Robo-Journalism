florence genova had a heart attack at her home in fort lee , new jersey , on september 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock .
her family today said they do n't believe her death was due to the delayed emergency response caused by the george washington bridge lane closures ordered by chris christie 's aides .
mrs genova 's daughter vilma oleri , 57 , told the new york times : ' i honestly believe it was just her time '
