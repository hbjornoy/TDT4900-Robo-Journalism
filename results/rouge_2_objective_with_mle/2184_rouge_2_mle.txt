the gap in bachelor-degree attainment between the nation 's richest and poorest students by age 24 has doubled during the last four decades .
the percentage of students from the lowest-income families -- those making $ 34,160 a year or less -- earning a bachelor 's degree has inched up just 3 points since 1970 , rising from 6 to 9 percent by 2013 .
the study comes amid renewed debate on college affordability spurred by president barack obama 's proposal to make two years of college free .
