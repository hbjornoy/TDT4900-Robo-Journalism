dolphins are rightly known as being one of the most acrobatic species of sea creature .
they were performing at the first-ever flyboard north american championship in toronto at the weekend .
the flyboard was only invented three years ago , by frenchman franky zapata .
the pilot , using a throttle , controls the power of the water , allowing him or her to rise up to 35 feet in the air .
