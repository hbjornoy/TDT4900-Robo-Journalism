the sewage discharge affects nine beaches in thanet , kent , which relies heavily on summer tourism.they include walpole bay , palm bay , kingsgate bay , stone bay , louisa bay , viking bay and dumpton gap .
bathers were still allowed to go on the rest of the beach which remained open to the public .
bathers have been told not to enter the sea below the high water mark - the area of sand reached during a high tide -- and signs have been erected warning of the dangers .
