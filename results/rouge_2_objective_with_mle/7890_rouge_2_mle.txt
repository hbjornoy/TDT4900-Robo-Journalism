the health and safety executive has advised schools to destroy or make safe the artefacts following tests to look for asbestos fibres and advice from the imperial war museum .
the artefacts are an important aid for teaching pupils about the home front and it would be ` terrible ' if those which could be made safe were destroyed .
the advice comes after the hse carried out tests on vintage gas masks , the majority of which contained asbestos in the filters , often the more dangerous crocidolite , or blue asbestos .
