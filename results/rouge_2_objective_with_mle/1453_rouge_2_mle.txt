the top stones were created using biface technology , which involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone .
the discovery centres on a stone tool production method known as levallois technology .
the find suggests eurasians were more innovative than previously thought .
the resulting flakes were then used as knives or other tools , which would have been relatively easy to carry by the fast-moving hunter-gatherers of the time .
