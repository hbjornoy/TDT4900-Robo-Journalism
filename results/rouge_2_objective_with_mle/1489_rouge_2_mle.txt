fifa president sepp blatter was given an extraordinary mandate to carry on as fifa president for as long as he declared he is ready to stand for a fifth term next year .
this followed fifa congress delegates voting overwhelmingly against age and term limits for 78-year-old blatter to lead world football 's ruling body as an octogenarian and beyond .
he immediately hit back at fa chairman greg dyke and dutch chief michael van praag .
