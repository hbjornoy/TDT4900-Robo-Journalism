victims of bernie madoff 's fraud will soon receive $ 2.48 billion to help cover their losses .
the payout more than triples their total recovery to about $ 3.63 billion , but is still only half of what was lost , the trustee liquidating the imprisoned swindler 's firm said .
the average payout is $ 2.02 million , or 53 per cent of the $ 17.3 billion he believes was lost in madoff 's ponzi scheme .
the u.s. supreme court let stand a lower court decision that endorsed picard 's methods for calculating losses .
