eric joyce was convicted of assault in 2012 after head-butting a fellow mp in a bar , racked up the bill on train tickets and other expenses -- some of which was put on a special parliamentary credit card .
commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around # 1,000 a month from mr joyce 's wages after he objected to handing back the cash .
mr joyce , who was kicked out of the labour party following the 2012 commons brawl , is not standing for election in may and will therefore still owe thousands of pounds after leaving parliament .
