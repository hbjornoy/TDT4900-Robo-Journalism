the state supreme court on monday sent the matter back to lawrence county juvenile court to hold a hearing about the evidence used to convict jordan brown of the february 2009 shotgun killing of 26-year-old kenzie hook and her unborn son at their home near wampum .
one of brown 's attorneys , lourdes rosado , said his lawyers will file a motion seeking a new trial , arguing that his prior adjudication of delinquency in juvenile court went against the weight of the evidence .
brown was arrested less than one day after houk 's death .
