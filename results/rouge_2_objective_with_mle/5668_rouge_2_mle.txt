the property near lake worth , texas , had been in david underwood 's family for decades and belonged to his late grandmother .
but when he visited the house on saturday , all that remained was a clean slab of concrete .
mr underwood , who works for a company that builds community centres , said : ` we looked up there and sure enough , it 's gone !
