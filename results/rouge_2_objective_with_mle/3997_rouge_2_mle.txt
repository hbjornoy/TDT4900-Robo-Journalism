more than 750 foreign criminals - including 11 rapists , are walking the streets after jumping bail .
the home office is refusing to identify the criminals by name because to do so would breach their ` right ' to privacy .
the total also includes six burglars , 26 robbers , at least two killers and several child abusers and arsonists .
