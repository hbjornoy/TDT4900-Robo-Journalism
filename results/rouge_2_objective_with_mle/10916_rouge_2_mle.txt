roberto martinez has not ruled out the prospect of antolin alcaraz or sylvain distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club 's future .

the toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - tyias browning and brendan galloway the two most likely to benefit .
