alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas found butch , a homeless and dying boston terrier , the week before thanksgiving and lavished him with attention for a few days until he had to be put down .
the terrier had an owner and a home but was left to live in the streets , al.com through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal .
the vet suggested he was scheduled for a ` humane euthanasia ' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog .
