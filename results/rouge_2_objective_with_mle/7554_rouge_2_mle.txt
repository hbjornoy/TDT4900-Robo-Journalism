d-day veteran fred cannon , 90 , is left with just # 10 a week from his war pension - the rest pays for his care .
he is among thousands of injured former servicemen and women forced to pay for social care because they were injured on or before april 5 , 2005 .
the royal british legion is campaigning for an end to the ` profoundly unfair ' system , and is calling on the government to set aside funding so all injured veterans receive the social care they need .
