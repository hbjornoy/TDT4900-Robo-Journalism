economists moshe hazan and hosny zoabi have discovered that fertility rates among american women with advanced degrees have risen by over 50 per cent in the last 30 years , reports the observer .
economists are down to a rapidly rising inequality gap between women who work hard and can afford to pay for childcare and those who provide the services at an affordable price .
this is a significant rise from 1980 , when the fertility rate was 1.2 for women who had studied for 16 years or more .
