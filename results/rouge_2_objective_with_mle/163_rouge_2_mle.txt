study at the university of iowa has found a potential link between a hormone and short-term memory loss in older people .
it revealed that having high levels in cortisol - a natural hormone in the body , which increases when a person is stressed - can lead to memory lapses as a person ages .
the hormone allows a person to cope , helping the body to respond to life 's challenges by making it more alert .
