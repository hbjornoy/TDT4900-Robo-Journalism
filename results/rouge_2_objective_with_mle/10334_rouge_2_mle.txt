james brady , 59 , last night criticized the hackensack 's human service department 's ` lack of compassion ' in cancelling his general assistance and medicaid payments .
the department controversially denied brady his $ 210 monthly assistance until the end of the year because he failed to report his ` income ' after police returned the unclaimed money to him in october .
