will immke , 23 , had cleared the snow from a disabled neighbor 's driveway and sidewalk in eastlake , ohio on sunday so that she could move around safely .
the good deed did n't impress 69-year-old larry myers , who lives next door to the woman .
immke told the man he was clearing the sidewalk for the neighbor and so that children could reach their school buses , myers told him the kids could walk in the street .
myers later grabbed immke and now faces an assault charge .
