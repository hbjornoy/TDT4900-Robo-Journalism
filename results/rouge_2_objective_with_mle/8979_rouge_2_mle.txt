the jet , which appears to be an su-24 , flew low over the al-gouta area during its bombing run before leaving the area .
the mission is believed to be in response to an earlier attack islamist fighters struck the syrian capital with at least 38 rockets on sunday , killing seven people , a monitoring group said .
