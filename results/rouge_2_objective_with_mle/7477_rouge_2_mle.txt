archaeologists will begin charting the site of the staffordshire model of the battle of messines , belgium , which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops from the war .
the model was built by german prisoners of the first world war 's bloodiest battlefields .
the ridge formed an anchor in the german front lines but the week-long offensive of infantry attack , aerial bombardment and heavy shelling resulted in an allied victory with four victoria crosses awarded to empire soldiers for bravery during the fight .
