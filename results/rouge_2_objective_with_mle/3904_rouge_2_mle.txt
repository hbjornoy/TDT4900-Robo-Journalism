independent liquor and gaming authority chief executive micheil brodie said the speedy probity clearance was far below the average of the 12 months it normally takes .
james packer 's crown resorts cleared a probity check in just three months to run a new casino in sydney .
mr brodie , who oversaw the probity check , said the process was fast-tracked because the nsw government advised the gaming authority to take into account the findings of an earlier probity check into mr packer 's company .
