a huge meteor smashing through the earth 's atmosphere broke up into ten million tonnes of fiery fragments , scattering over four continents .
these fragments are thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun , causing temperatures to plummet , plants to die and landscapes to alter forever .
the woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the earth .
