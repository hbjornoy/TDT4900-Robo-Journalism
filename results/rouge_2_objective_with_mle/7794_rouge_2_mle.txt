astronomers have detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the big bang .
this is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation .

the theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble .
