west ham midfielder cheikhou kouyate has warned west ham must be ready to face a ` wounded animal ' at manchester city on sunday .
the barclays premier league champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches , thrashed 4-2 at rivals united last weekend .
west ham are also in need a pick-me-up , having seen victory slip through their fingers when stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at upton park .
