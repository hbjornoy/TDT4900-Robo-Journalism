roman shilov , whose wife and the baby daughter live in brisbane , was detained by russian authorities on charges of drug trafficking in july 2012 .
the australian and russian citizen has been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk despite the australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport , a letter from foreign affairs minister julie bishop has revealed .
the letter also noted that the russian government was refusing to recognise mr shilov 's dual nationality which in turn ` seriously limits the ability of australian government to provide consular assistance '
