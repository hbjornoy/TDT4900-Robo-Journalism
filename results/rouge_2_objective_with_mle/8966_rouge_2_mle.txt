chilling video has emerged of the mobile paramilitary brigade called brimob in firing practice ahead of the last round of executions on nusa kambangan , where chan and sukumaran are due to be shifted 72 hours ahead of their deaths by firing squad .
this comes as coffins arrived at a christian church in cilacap , the nearest port of cilacap , where a local indonesian caretaker was pictured preparing four caskets in preparation for the executions .
this will be used on australians andrew chan and myuran sukumaran .
