alaska state troopers say the gun went off as james doppler was handling it last weekend .
james doppler , 43 , shot himself with a .22 rifle on saturday and , rather than seek proper treatment , used the antibiotic cream neosporin on the wound .
troopers say his girlfriend urged him to go the hospital but he refused , believing at the time he did n't need outside help .
