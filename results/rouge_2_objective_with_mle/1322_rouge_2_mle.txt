former princeton university president william bowen used his sunday commencement speech at haverford college , in suburban philadelphia , to criticize students who campaigned against the speaker he replaced - robert birgeneau , former chancellor of the university of california , berkeley .
dozens of students demanded he write a letter explaining his reasons for calling in police to disperse a 2011 occupy protest on the ucb campus .
birgeneau is among several commencement speakers who canceled their appearances this spring amid student protests .
