seven-year-old polar bear giovanna gave birth to her twins two days ago in the birthing den at the hellabrunn zoo in munich , germany , on monday .
they are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in europe this year and their mother positioned herself in the direct view of cctv cameras set up to record the moment .
giovanna was so busy with her first born that she did n't immediately realise that she 'd even given birth to a second baby for another 20 minutes .
