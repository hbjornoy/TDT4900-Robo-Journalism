the move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of derriford hospital in plymouth , devon .
the developer built a 600-space multi-storey car park , which the hospital now pays an annual fee to lease back , and included units for several shops on the same site .
wharfside 's deal with pizza hut for one of the units - the first food shop to open - was agreed last year .
