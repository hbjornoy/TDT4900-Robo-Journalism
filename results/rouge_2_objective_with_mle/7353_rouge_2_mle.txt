matthew sheets , 26 , has designed a weight-activated seat sensor which notifies a parent 's mobile phone when their child is still in their baby seat .
the alert appears on their phone once they step outside of a 20ft -lrb- 6 metres -rrb- radius from the baby seat if they 've forgotten to take their child out of its seat .
mr sheets , founder of studio whale who made the device , became a father to henry for the first time just over four months ago .
