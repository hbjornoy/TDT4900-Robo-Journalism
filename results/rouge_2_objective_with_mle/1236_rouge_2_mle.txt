the body of reverend bob thorn , 59 , was washed up on a beach near seatown , just five miles from his parish of burton bradstock , dorset , on monday .
he is believed to have been rowing the 150 miles back to his parish along the south coast when he rowed a 10ft wooden boat from his home in dorset to cornwall last month .
the body was found in a small cove a few hundred feet along the beach from where his boat was on a three-month sabbatical .
