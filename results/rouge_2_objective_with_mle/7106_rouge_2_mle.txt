volunteers in vancouver , canada , used 65,000 full tins of everything from tuna to tomatoes to create sculptures ranging from florida 's space shuttle to dutch windmills .
this year 's theme was conceived in new york in 1992 by cheri melillo , a member of the society of design administration .
the sculptures will be dismantled and their contents will be donated to food banks .
