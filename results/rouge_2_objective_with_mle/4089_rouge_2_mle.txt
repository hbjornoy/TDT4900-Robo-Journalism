the river reportedly reached its sixth highest level on record close to st louis , missouri , and barriers were breached yesterday forcing authorities to urge homeowners to flee their properties in a small community north of the city .
the breach of the barrier , which holds the river back close to its confluence with the missouri river , saw two miles of land deluged by flood waters .
