u.s. district judge alvin hellerstein 's ruling on friday gives the government , which has fought the case for over a decade , two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released .
the american civil liberties union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable .
the fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
