nick kyrgios was smashing his way into the quarter-finals of the australian open against italy 's andreas seppi on sunday .
his mother was pacing the corridors of the hisense arena , too nervous to watch the match .
the young tennis star served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6 -lrb- 5 -rrb- 8-6 win to overcome the italian .
kyrgios has recently drawn some criticism for his swearing and feisty exchanges with the crowd at the melbourne open .
