caravans are parked up in a road next to the site after a 10 year legal battle with basildon council ended with hundreds of police removing residents in october 2011 .
the travellers are still living illegally at the dale farm camp two years after the eviction , after taking ' a little holiday to southend ' travellers were forcibly removed from dale farm where they were evicted by police and bailiffs in a costly operation two years ago .
