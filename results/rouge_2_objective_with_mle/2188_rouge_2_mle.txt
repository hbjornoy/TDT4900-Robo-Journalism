plants use a newly discovered ` language ' to ` speak ' to each other , research has revealed .
they studied the molecular communication between a parasitic plant called dodder , and two host plants , arabidopsis and tomatoes .
the finding opens the door to a new area of science that explores how plants communicate with each other on a molecular level .
it could also give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world .
