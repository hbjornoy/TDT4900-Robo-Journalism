six of the austrian industrialist richard neumann 's 18th century italian and german paintings were found , including abraham and the three angels by sebastiano ricci .
the french ministry of culture said yesterday that seven works , including three held by the louvre , were to be returned to descendants of their jewish owners .
the seven paintings were destined for the fuhrermuseum - an unfinished museum that hitler wanted to build in linz , austria , where he grew up .
