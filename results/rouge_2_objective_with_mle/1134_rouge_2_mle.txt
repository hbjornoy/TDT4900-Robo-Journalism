25 per cent of patients at neighbouring ealing and northwick park hospitals have now been left waiting more than four hours a year ago .
it is also more than twice the number of patients -lrb- 11 per cent -rrb- who waited more than two hours for emergency treatment .
the revelations are a damning indictment of moves to close a&e s .
the mail on sunday has been campaigning against the closures , which can leave patients having to travel further or wait longer for life .
