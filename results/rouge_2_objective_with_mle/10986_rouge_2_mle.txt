english-spoken song lyrics are more miserable than russian literature , which has brought us less-than-cheery classic novels such as anna karenina and crime and punishment .
only chinese novels and korean film subtitles -- which can be full of violence and gothic themes , were ranked less happy than english song lyrics .
