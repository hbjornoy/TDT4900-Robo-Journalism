the latest pieces hit are a stencil on the side of a building in woodside , queens , and a car that was part of an installation on ludlow street on the lower east side .
the ludlow street piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night-vision goggles .
the piece in queens was damaged about 9 p.m. monday , just 13 hours after it had gone up .
