the prickly australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the mornington peninsula , 83 km south of melbourne .
the video of the swimming echidna , which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel , was posted online by youtube user emma b .
the echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is found all over australia , in coastal forests , alpine meadows and desert habitats .
