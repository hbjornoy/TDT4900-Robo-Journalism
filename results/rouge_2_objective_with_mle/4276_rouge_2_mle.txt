the dark sword - known in chinese as `` anjian '' - made its debut at the zhuhai airshow in southern china 's guangdong province .
the model was subsequently exhibited at the paris air show - but was never heard of again .
some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons .
