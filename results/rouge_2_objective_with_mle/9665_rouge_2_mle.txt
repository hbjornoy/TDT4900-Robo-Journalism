korean photographer kwon o chul was on hand to record the breathtaking phenomenon in march 2013 to capture a celestial event known as an aurora substorm - a brief disturbance in the earth 's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released .
chul 's five-minute video shows a starry sky over the town of yellowknife swirling with swaths of brilliant green light edged in pink .
the green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles above the planet 's surface .
