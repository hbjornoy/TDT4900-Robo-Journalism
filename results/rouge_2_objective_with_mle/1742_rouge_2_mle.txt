around 70 women descended on the shop in nottingham city centre to show support for 25-year-old wioletta komar , who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son .
mrs komar had been sitting on a bench inside the store waiting for her father edward morawiec , 63 , who was trying on a t-shirts .
the sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to mcdonald 's which had a baby and mother room .
