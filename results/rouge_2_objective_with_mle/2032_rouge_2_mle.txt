the driver of the lorry , 35-year-old bosnian braslav bosanac bosanac , had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel before leaving the road and was taken to hospital with serious but non life threatening injuries .
the accident made it look as if austria 's river gurk had been through a real-life sodastream -lrb- right -rrb- machine .
the bosnian lorry driver spilled 26,000 litres of soda into the river gurk close to the city of klagenfurt , making the water so frothy that it resembled fizzy pop .
