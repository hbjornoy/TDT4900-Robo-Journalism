blackpool boss lee clark sees no reason why his new employers can not start dreaming of top-flight football again in the sky bet championship .
lee clark would take the reins at bloomfield road just 10 days after fellow sky bet birmingham parted company with him following two seasons at st andrew 's .
blackpool chairman karl oyston opted to bring clark on board after the inevitable sacking of embattled boss jose riga on monday .
the former birmingham boss has only been out of work for 10 days .
