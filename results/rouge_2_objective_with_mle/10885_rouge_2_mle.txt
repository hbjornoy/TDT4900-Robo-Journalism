the blue anchor at minehead , in somerset , has been forced to close its children 's garden play area that backs on to the cliffs which are crumbling at a dangerous rate of a metre a month .
the play area 's ship was moved at a cost of # 800,000 a year ago to a safer location - one that is now crumbling , as more huge chunks of the beer garden slump onto the beach .
the hotel has reduced the size of its beer garden due to the erosion with 13ft slipping into the sea in just three months .
