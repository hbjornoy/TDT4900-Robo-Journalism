john schindler , a former nsa intelligence critic of whistle-blower edward snowden , was placed on leave on monday after his flirtatious emails and a racy photo of his penis were posted on twitter .
the woman , who lists her name as lesley , says she received explicit photos and messages from a married professor at the u.s. naval war college in rhode island .
lesley allegedly gave screenshots of schindler 's intimate messages to @t3h_arch3r , a self-described internet troll , who then posted the photos online .
