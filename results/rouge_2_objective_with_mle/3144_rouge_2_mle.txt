the facebook pages , created on the day the plane crashed , baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the mh17 disaster .
scammers have created fake facebook accounts for mh17 victims , including the three young perth children who died with their grandfather .
the scam also exploited the names of victims from other countries , including quinn lucas schansman from the us , british-born kiwi rob ayley and richard mayne , ben pocock and liam sweeney from the uk .
