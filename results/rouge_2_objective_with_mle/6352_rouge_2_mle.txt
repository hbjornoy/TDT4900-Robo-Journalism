hull kr have plugged the gap created by the loss of front row pair michael weyman and ryan bailey with the capture of experienced australian forward dane tilse from canberra raiders .
the 6ft 7in , 17st-plus tilse has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the robins and will join them as soon as he receives the necessary paperwork after the raiders agreed to release him .
tilse comes in after the sudden retirement of michael weyman , the new hull kr captain who announced his retirement due to injury last month .
