jane sandalls , 26 , died in a head-on collision with a newly-qualified driver who skidded on black ice at the bend on the b4437 in charlbury , oxfordshire .
the bbc 's hit show used the site - a few miles from clarkson 's oxfordshire home - as the stage for a stunt , resulting in a dramatic crash which will be screened later this year .
the move has drawn concerns from some local figures , including woodstock councillor victoria edwards , who used to rehabilitate boy racers .
