the son , just 22 months old at the time , suffered four broken bones in his arm and shoulder and numerous bruises to his head and body in a week .
his horrific injuries were revealed at preston crown court in lancashire as the 22-year-old ` depressed ' woman was jailed for four years .
the woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to pin the blame for the injuries on others .
