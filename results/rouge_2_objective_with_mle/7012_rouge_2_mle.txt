enrique d. nu√±ez 's email , which appears to be a forwarded newsletter from the classist , at times racist , blog ` people of walmart , ' features more than a dozen candid photos of obese , tattooed , and questionably-dressed customers of the mega-retailer , which is pushing to build a store in midtown miami .

the email was sent during office hours on march 6 , 2013 and the recipients are from the department charged with reviewing and approving walmart 's application .
