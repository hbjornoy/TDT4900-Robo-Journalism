tariq al-hashemi , iraq 's top sunni official , is set to be arrested on terrorism charges by the country 's shiite-led government .
the last u.s. troops left iraq at the end of the eight-year war , the moves signals a sharp escalation in the sectarian tensions that drove the country to the brink of civil war a few years ago .
mr al-hashemi is one of the leaders of the sunni-backed political bloc iraqiya , which has just suspended its participation in parliament to protest against the control of key posts by shiite prime minister nouri al-maliki .
