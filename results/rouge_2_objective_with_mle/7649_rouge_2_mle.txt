the massive inflatable - designed by dutch artist florentijn hofman to be a giant version of the popular bath toy - burst today while it was on show at the port of keelung in the north of the country .
it had been on display there for 11 days , only to explode at around noon - hours before large crowds were expected to gather to welcome 2014 .
