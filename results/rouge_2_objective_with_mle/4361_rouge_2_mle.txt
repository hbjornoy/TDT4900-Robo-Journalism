darren clarke admitted it would be remiss of him not to put his personal differences with paul mcginley to one side .
the 46-year-old , who played in the biennial contest five times and was a vice-captain in 2010 , was unanimously chosen ahead of miguel angel jimenez and thomas bjorn by a five-man selection panel at wentworth .
the selection panel consisted of the three most recent captains - mcginley , jose maria olazabal and colin montgomerie .
