fast food giant domino 's is selling ` frankenfood ' pizzas to customers while claiming to be ` gm-free ' on its website .
the double-dealing has been identified by gm freeze , which is campaigning to raise awareness about how gm foods are creeping into the national diet without the knowledge and approval of consumers .
the group 's director , liz o'neill , is now demanding an investigation to see if domino 's has broken labelling laws .
