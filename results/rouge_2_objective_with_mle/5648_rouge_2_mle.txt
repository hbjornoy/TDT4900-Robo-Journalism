louis van gaal has played down his role in the development of jose mourinho 's success as a boss .
van gaal faces the toughest test of his reign as manchester united manager on sunday when the dutchman offered the then 34-year-old coach a position on his coaching staff at barcelona .
mourinho spent three years by van gaal 's side and the relationship worked perfectly , with barca winning two primera division titles and the copa del rey while the two men were stationed in the home dugout .
