freda owens suffered horrific burns after a carer at the croft house rest home in freckleton , lancashire sat her on a commode of boiling water from a kettle thinking it would help her condition .
the painful injuries on her backside had forced her to lie on her side - and this caused a deep tissue pressure sore close to her left hip bone to worsen .
the sore continued to go unnoticed until christmas eve - nearly two months after the incident .
