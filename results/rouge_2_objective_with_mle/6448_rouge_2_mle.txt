comedian sarah silverman was caught exaggerating a story about being paid less than a man for a gig - to highlight the gender pay gap .
the comic and feminist campaigner recalled an incident at the new york comedy club owner al martin revealed the story was false , because silverman had been paid less purely because she appeared as a guest on the show and was n't meant to receive anything - her male counterpart todd barry was booked for the slot .
silverman accused martin of paying her $ 50 less than barry to perform .
