the dashboard camera has captured the unnamed driver travelling along a melbourne road when a red ute with p-plates quickly cuts into the lane to turn right at an intersection .
the red ute appears to look frustrated at the slow moving traffic as they attempt to overtake by carelessly swerving onto the wrong side of the road .
the driver is seen wandering off the screen while a young woman , donning a black hooded jacket , pulls the middle finger at the driver as she walks closer to the vehicle .
