father-of-two john stoner , 42 , dug up the extremely rare new england coin in a field outside the village of king 's clipstone in nottinghamshire .
it has been hailed as one of the finest examples of a currency produced in the days of the pilgrim fathers in a land that would become the united states .
mr stoner , who temporarily mislaid the coin at one point , found it while on an outing with the coil to the soil metal detector club on sunday .
the club immediately posted a picture of the coin on its facebook page and invited followers to identify it .
