juan mata was annoyed to see his manchester united team-mates resort to route-one football at times in saturday 's disappointing draw at burnley .
angel di maria , playing in a midfield three alongside mata and darren fletcher , produced flashes of brilliance , but wayne rooney and robin van persie both had off days up front and could not convert a host of chances .
united did not help their cause in the first half by launching long balls to their strikers .
