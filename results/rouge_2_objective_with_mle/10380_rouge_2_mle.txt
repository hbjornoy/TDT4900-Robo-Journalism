the woman , from nearby bracknell , was then taken in for questioning on suspicion of murder but released on conditional police bail later on friday .
the suspect , 63 , was detained by detectives investigating the patient 's death at the ascot nursing home in ascot , berkshire , where a 63-year-old carer has been arrested .
the care home , set in its own well-tended grounds and very close to ascot racecourse , is privately run and has mostly single ground floor rooms which patients are encouraged to decorate with their own ornaments and belongings .
