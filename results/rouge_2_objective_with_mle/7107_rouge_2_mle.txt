experts have developed new led lighting for greenhouses which fool strawberry plants into thinking that it is spring rather than winter .
it means the strawberry plants can be kept in artificial light for a lower cost , according to researchers at stockbridge technology centre in selby , north yorkshire .
wallings nursery in essex plans to use the technology this year to ripen up to 30 tonnes of fruit that it would normally have thrown away after the plants died back in the autumn .
the nursery is one of the biggest suppliers of british strawberries and the extra crop from the three-hectare site is estimated to be worth Ã¢ # 100,000 .
