locals in richmond , london , have become the first in the uk to pay for products on the high street using a profile picture .
the borough 's high street has begun using a payment system that works by simply recognising customers by their first name and picture via a mobile phone app .
the customer 's name and photo then appears on the shop 's payment system and the retailer charges them by clicking on their image .
