thor , a pit bull-boxer mix , did n't hesitate when a robber attacked his owner justin ireland , pouncing on the intruder and scaring him off in a matter of seconds .
ireland was working the afternoon shift at a gas station in saco , maine when he said a man walked up to the door and asked if he could use a phone .
ireland has never trained thor and said the dog acted on sheer instinct .
