natalya lukyantseva , an official in the sverdlovsk regional office of the agency , told ria novosti and interfax that unplanned checks were being carried out in a number of restaurants after residents voiced safety concerns .
four branches of the chain were the first to open in the soviet union in 1990 , drawing crowds of thousands that circled around the block .
the restaurant became a symbol of domestic reform and openness with the west , and today it is one of the company 's most visited venues in russia .
