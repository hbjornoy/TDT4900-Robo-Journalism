when janet and barry ashdown bought their home in holderness , east yorkshire in 1986 one of the main attractions was the large extended double garage .
janet ashdown standing next to the garage and wall that the council are insisting is pulled down .
the problem became apparent when the retired couple , who are looking to rebuild their garage , noticed that the previous owners had n't registered the extension with land registry .
