the washington department of fish and wildlife -lrb- wdfw -rrb- has developed the bizarre cannon to move hatchery and chinook salmon upriver in washington state .
the fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds when they enter the whooshh tube .
the device can move the fish from the weir of the washougal river up to the riverbank with minimal handling .
