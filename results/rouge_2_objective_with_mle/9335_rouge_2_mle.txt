the footage recorded at fort worth zoo in texas , shows two elephants in an enclosure -- one clutching a stick in its trunk while swinging it up against a large log on the ground .
the elephant lifts its leg and slowly begins to apply its weight to the centre point in the hope of snapping it in two .
the other elephant , who appears to be eating , looks on nonchalantly .
