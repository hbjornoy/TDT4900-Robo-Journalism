a federal judge said she was tentatively satisfied with a proposal to add barbara bennett the new named plaintiff in the lawsuit over apple 's itunes software and the price of its ipods .
the case actually started with three plaintiffs suing apple nearly 10 years ago , but two of them withdrew and the judge disqualified the last one , marianna rosen , on monday amid indications that rosen did n't herself purchase any of the affected ipods during the time frame covered by the suit .
apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market .
