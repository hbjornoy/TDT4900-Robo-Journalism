the luton-based firm has announced it is to start offering some passengers the opportunity to pay one price for their ticket .
the firm has charged customers less than many of its rivals for the first time in its 18-year history in a move that could signal a change in direction for budget airliners .
the airline claims its new all-inclusive fare will be lower than if customers had chosen to book all the extras on top of their standard ticket .
