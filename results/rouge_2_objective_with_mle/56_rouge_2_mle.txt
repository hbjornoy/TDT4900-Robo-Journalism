the bag was found in an underground car park in the design centre of the development on monday afternoon .
it is understood that mrs brooks 's husband charlie tried to reclaim the computer and phone , but could not prove they were his - and the guards called police instead .
the guards were discovered in a car park close to the chelsea harbour complex where the brooks have a # 1.5 m apartment .
mr brooks 's spokesman denied the bag belonged to mrs brooks , a former racehorse trainer and close friend of the prime minister david cameron .
