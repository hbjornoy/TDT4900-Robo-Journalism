carl frampton will defend his ibf super-bantamweight title against chris avalos in belfast a week on saturday .
the rising cross-over star of the british ring , from ulster idolatry to appreciation on mainland uk , is so grounded in belfast that he is considering back-tracking on his recent move with his young family to a farmhouse outside his home town .
frampton will be beamed live not only across the irish sea .
