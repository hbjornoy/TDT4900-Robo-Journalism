bbc bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour , which was planned to be fronted by jeremy clarkson along with co-presenters james may and richard hammond under the bbc top gear brand .
the future of the shows , which have sold 200,000 tickets , has been cast into doubt after clarkson was dismissed from the bbc last week for an ` unprovoked ' attack on a top gear producer .
clarkson was due to front the top gear live tour from next month .
