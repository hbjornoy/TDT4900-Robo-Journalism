australian federal police have posted a humorous post on their official facebook page , updating the public on a drug bust by using cringeworthy fish puns .
two men were arrested for trying to import $ 75 million worth of drugs into sydney hidden underneath frozen fish .
the post uses terrible ` dad jokes ' to explain that , ` investigators knew that salmon was responsible '
