jayde scholl , a chinese orphan adopted by an american doctor last year , was due to have a cochlear hearing device implanted in her ear last week .
the implant , which costs between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000 , was lost when the moore medical center was destroyed during the storm which wrecked 20,000 homes and killed 24 people last monday .
jayde 's operation was then postponed indefinitely while doctors considered the logistics of finding a replacement implant .
