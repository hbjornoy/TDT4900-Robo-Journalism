catharine bell , 46 , was left struggling to balance , nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in marmaris , turkey , in 2005 .
she was diagnosed with mal de debarquement syndrome -lrb- mdds -rrb- and has suffered from incurable , and sometimes debilitating , attacks ever .
ms bell , from bellingham , northumberland , thought the feeling would pass but was horrified when her symptoms worsened throughout the holiday until she could no longer walk down the hotel corridor without holding onto the wall .
