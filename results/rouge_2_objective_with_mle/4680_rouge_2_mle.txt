veronica smith , from east sussex , fell in love with her daughter , catherine , the second she was laid in her arms .
her happiness was not to last because veronica , then 24 , was an unmarried mother brought up in a butlin 's holiday camp in bognor regis when she became pregnant .
veronica smith was sent to a catholic hostel when she was pregnant after a brief fling with a ` red coat ' when she realised she was going to have a child .
veronica says she hopes the british government will follow the example of australia and offer an apology to women whose children were taken away .
