the raiders were foiled by a brave employee who barricaded the door to the premises , and they proceeded to flee on a motorbike .
one of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at uncle jewellers and pawn brokers .
the attempted break-in took place in pemberton , a suburb of wigan in greater manchester , on saturday afternoon .
