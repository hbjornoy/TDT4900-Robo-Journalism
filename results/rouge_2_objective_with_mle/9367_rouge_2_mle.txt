manchester united manager louis van gaal has asked his players not to play as many backpasses to goalkeeper david de gea as he faces mounting criticism over his side 's unadventurous performances this season .
united fans booed their team during saturday 's 2-0 win against sunderland , most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their spanish ` keeper ' van persie remains out with an ankle injury for manchester united 's trip to newcastle .
