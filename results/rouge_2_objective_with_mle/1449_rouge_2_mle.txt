paul alton , 51 , claimed he kept the gun for the ` humane killing ' of the cattle on his remote farm in bacup , lancashire .
the weapon was crudely constructed from lumps of wood , belts and tags , attached to a barrel from an air rifle and could shoot ammunition that would mushroom on hitting flesh .
