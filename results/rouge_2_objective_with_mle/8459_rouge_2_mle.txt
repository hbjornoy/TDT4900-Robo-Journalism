the canadian town of cape st george got into trouble with the online marketplace yesterday when it posted a listing for a dead whale that washed onto its shores last week .
mayor peter fenwick says the town was informed that it was their responsibility to get rid of the rotting 40-foot sperm whale .
fenwick was also informed by environment canada that selling the endangered sperm whale carcass violates the federal act protecting species at risk .
