winston bogarde has claimed that chelsea never asked him to take a pay cut on his # 40,000-a-week salary and the club also would n't send him out on loan for anything less than 100 per cent of his wages being paid during his ill-fated spell at stamford bridge .
the dutch defender joined chelsea in 2000 but rarely featured in chelsea 's first team .
