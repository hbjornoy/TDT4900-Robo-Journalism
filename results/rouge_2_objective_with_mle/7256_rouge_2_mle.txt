big-hitting australian cricketer mitchell johnson was at his destructive best in zimbabwe when he belted it back over the head of zimbabwean seamer tinashe panyangara and straight towards commentators neil manthorp and pommie mbangwa .
mbangwa , a former zimbabwean paceman , was left to pick the flying shrapnel out of the inside of his shirt during the second last over of australia 's record breaking innings .
the all-rounder was one of a number of australian batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including glenn maxwell 92 and mitchell marsh who hit 83 .
