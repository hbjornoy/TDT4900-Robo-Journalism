united passions , which was launched with blatter in attendance at the cannes film festival yesterday , tells the history of fifa through founder jules rimet , joao havelange and blatter himself -- who is depicted by tim roth .
it is understood the film , which has received a lukewarm reaction , cost # 19million to make , of which fifa paid # 16million , although a zurich source claimed it was only half that amount -- but still a huge investment .
blatter is expected to be unopposed when he stands for a fifth term at the annual congress in sao paulo at the start of june .
