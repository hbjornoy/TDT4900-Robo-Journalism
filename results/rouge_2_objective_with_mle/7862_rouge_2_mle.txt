he was openly contradicted after praising home secretary theresa may for doing a ` good job ' on the controversial issue .
tory backbencher philip davies rounded on mr cameron , saying : ` i do n't think she 's done a good job at all !
' the row came at a private meeting of tory mps last week , held amid growing chaos in calais where migrants are mounting increasingly frantic attempts to board cross-channel ferries or hide in uk-bound vehicles .
