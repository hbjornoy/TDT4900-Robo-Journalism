the dolphin morris men revived the 12th century event , dating back to 1109 , in 1981 and have carried it out every year since .
this saturday will be the last time they dance 20 miles from nottingham to southwell every year in a 900-year-old tradition but can no longer afford to close roads and cope with the magnitude of paperwork .
the procession , started in 1109 , cost # 500 this year and took weeks to organise , co-ordinators say .
