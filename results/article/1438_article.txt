the average briton only feels 100 per cent fit and healthy for 61 days of the year , it emerged yesterday .
for the rest of the time they are soldiering through four colds , one dose of flu , five cricked necks along with numerous other illnesses .
it means most of us operate at well below our best for almost ten months of the year .
a study found we suffer one bout of flu and four colds on average per year .
the study of 2,000 people found one in four is permanently hampered by at least one ailment or injury which has not been resolved .
worryingly , the research , commissioned by spire bristol hospital , also found the average brits feels ` run down ' on at least two days every week .
hospital director rob anderson said : ` it 's surprising to see just how little of the year people consider themselves fully fit .
` if someone is plagued by a repeated problem they should talk to a healthcare professional to identify if it might be a symptom of something more serious .
` while people often like to see themselves as good at enduring pain and adopt a ` grin and bear it ' approach , it 's important to recognise what 's easily treatable and can relieve us from a lot of unnecessary suffering day to day .
` often small changes can make a huge difference to how healthy we feel - making sure you get enough sleep , eating a balanced diet , taking exercise .
cutting down on alcohol can reduce illness and increase energy levels , but sometimes only medical treatment will do .
