' a lawyer for mark johnston says his client was so drunk when he lost the money that he could n't see his playing cards .
johnston is suing the casino , citing nevada gambling laws , which forbid ` permitting persons who are visibly intoxicated to participate in gaming activity ' and ` complimentary service of intoxicating beverages in the casino area to persons who are visibly intoxicated .
' he 's not willing to take responsibility for being ` blackout drunk ' either .
' i believe them just keep bringing me drinks , i blame that on them , and then continuously letting me gamble and letting me drink , i blame that on them , ' he told cbs news .
johnston estimates that he had two to four drinks at the burbank airport , one drink on the flight to las vegas , two drinks in his limousine when he arrived , and ` several more ' drinks at dinner .
after dinner , a 17-hour gambling binge ensued , which , says johnston , he does n't remember .
but memory or no , johnston appears to have had quite the time in sin city .
so much so that he took out a loan with the hotel for $ 500,000 .
and promptly lost it all .
and therein lies their claim , said johnston 's attorney sean lyttle .
` you certainly are n't to issue half a million dollars in markers to someone who 's intoxicated ,
