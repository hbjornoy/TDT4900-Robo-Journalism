a young syrian boy has been hailed a hero after a video showing him running through sniper fire to save a girl emerged online .
the one-minute clip shows the boy running from the left side of the frame and coming under fire as he dashes towards a car-wreck .
as he runs shots are fired at him and he appears to fake being shot in the chest and falling over .
stopped : more shots are fired as he runs and it looks like the young boy has been hit in the chest .
second of fear : the boy falls to the ground , and for a short moment , the men filming thinks he has been killed .
a second later he gets up and disappears behind the car before emerging hand in hand with the terrified girl who has been hiding from fire .
he appears to struggle to convince her to run to safety , but the girl , dressed in pink , eventually runs with him as more shots are fired .
the video has not been independently verified , but it is believed to be from yabroud , a countryside town 50 miles from damascus .
survivor : seconds later , the boy gets up again , having fooled the snipers , and runs towards the car .
hero : the boy emerges from behind the car , holding the hands of a girl who has been hiding in fear .
bravery : the pair are being fired at , but the heroic boy convinces the girl to run .
success : the two children run out of sight , and appears to have made it across .
yabroud was the last rebel stronghold held by the fsa on the lebanese border before it fell to assad 's forces in march 2014 .
the video , which was uploaded yesterday , has already had nearly 500,000 views .
it was later re-published on youtube by sham news network , which is run by activists based in damascus .
several youtube comments claim the video is fake , but experts told the telegraph they have no reason to doubt its authenticity .
