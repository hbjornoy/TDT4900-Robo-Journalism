michael duthie was given 180 hours of community service yesterday after he admitted claiming benefits after a # 250,000 lottery win .
a lottery winner who claimed # 13,000 in benefits after his win escaped a jail term yesterday .
michael duthie won # 250,000 in march 2010 but continued to claim jobseeker 's allowance , housing benefit and council tax benefit , while spending # 50,000 of his prize on buying his council house .
