a lamb believed to be the biggest ever born in the uk weighs as much as a toddler .
the super-sized animal - christened the big one - was delivered via caesarean section on tuesday at ty mawr farm in denbigh , north wales .
it tipped the scales to a whopping 24lbs 2oz - almost three times the size of an average newborn lamb .
the big one -lrb- right -rrb- towers above other lambs that have also been born on the farm this week -lrb- left -rrb- .
dafydd fon ifan , who works full-time on the farm with parents edmund and llinos , said : ` the lamb is absolutely huge .
` it was delivered about five days early so it makes you wonder what size it would have been if the pregnancy had gone to term .
` we have had big lambs before but i have never seen anything like this .
` as soon as it was delivered the vet weighed it straight away and she was just smiling because of how big it was .
` dad and i guessed about eight or nine kilograms - we could n't believe it when she said 11 .
it is about the size of a three or four-week-old lamb .
' the previous record holder for the biggest lamb in the uk was joan , born in lancashire in 2013 .
the big one is 2oz heavier .
dafydd , 18 , said : ` the ewe went into labour early and we did n't even have a chance to deliver naturally .
` we had to take it to the vet for a caesarean because of the size of the lamb .
` it is healthy though , it 's spot on .
the ewe is doing well too .
they are together but she just ca n't keep up with the lamb 's demand for milk because it is so big .
` so i am having to feed it a lot of milk by bottle too .
it will be interesting to see how he develops .
