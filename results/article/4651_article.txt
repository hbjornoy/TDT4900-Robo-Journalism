shadow education secretary , labour 's tristram hunt , said he had ` real concerns ' with pupils being ` crammed ' into classrooms .
thousands of primary school children are being taught in giant classes of 50 , 60 or even 70 pupils , figures reveal today .
labour said there are nearly 15,000 in classes of 40 or more -- but faced an immediate backlash from critics who said the problem was created by the party 's previous policies .
shadow education secretary tristram hunt said he had ` real concerns ' about children being ` crammed ' into large classes .
however , critics point out that labour 's ` out of control ' immigration policy caused much of the pressure on places .
as well as direct immigration resulting in growing numbers of children at schools , pressure has also resulted from the so-called ` migrant baby boom ' as more children are born to mothers arriving in britain from overseas .
education secretary nicky morgan said : ` tristram hunt seems to have forgotten it was labour who cut 200,000 primary school places in the middle of a baby boom -- at the same time as letting immigration get out of control .
' labour published figures showing the number of primary pupils in classes of more than 30 has spiralled in the last four years .
in 2010 there were 31,000 such pupils , compared to the current total of 93,665 -- a rise of 200 per cent .
of those , nearly 40,000 are in classes of more than 36 pupils .
another 5,817 are in classes of 50 or more , 2,556 are in classes of 60 or more and 446 are in classes of 70 or more .
on current trends , mr hunt said , by 2020 the number of children in large classes of more than 30 pupils will top 450,000 .
that would account for around one in four of all primary pupils .
mr hunt said : ` in 2008 david cameron said ; `` the more we can get class sizes down the better '' , but as parents and pupils prepare to begin the new school year , there are real concerns about the number of children in classes of more than 30 infants under the tories
