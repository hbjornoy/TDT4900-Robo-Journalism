alan pardew wants to banish his nearly-man reputation in the fa cup and lead his crystal palace side all the way to wembley glory .
the 53-year-old lost as a player whilst with the eagles as manchester united lifted the trophy in 1990 after a replay , and came within seconds of leading west ham to the famous cup in 2006 only for steven gerrard to thrash home a stoppage-time equaliser - with liverpool going on to win on penalties .
since then pardew 's luck has been in short supply , winning just one fa cup tie in his near-four-year reign at newcastle before he left the club to return to selhurst park at the start of the year .
alan pardew said crystal palace have no chance of winning the league , but could win the fa cup .
but he led palace to victory at dover in the third round , his first game in charge , and visits another former club in southampton on saturday looking to push on for another tilt at the trophy .
` i 've had a couple of near shaves , ' he said .
' i think i 've been in a winning position after 12 minutes against man united and it got away from us .
and about two minutes against liverpool .
` so it would be nice to get a big trophy over the line but they 're not easy to come by in today 's game when you 're at clubs with such a disadvantage but the club does even it up .
` the chance of us winning the premier league is more or less zero or one per cent i should think .
but winning the cup is a possibility .
' pardew stressed the importance of cup success when it comes to building relationships with the fans .
pardew knows how a good cup run as a manager can endear you to the club 's fans - something he has already enjoyed since being appointed as neil warnock 's successor in south london given his previous spell with the club .
` we -lrb- west ham -rrb- came within two minutes of winning it , a penalty shoot-out - my god , ' he said when asked about his links with the competition .
` it gives you an affinity with the fans
