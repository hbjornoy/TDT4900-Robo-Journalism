roy hodgson made a mistake by revealing raheem sterling told him he was feeling tired ahead of england 's game against estonia , according to former england and liverpool midfielder danny murphy .
sterling has come under fire after he was left on the bench for england 's euro 2016 qualifier in estonia .
the 19-year-old was replaced by liverpool team-mate adam lallana in the staring xi , but he came on in the second half and played his part in england 's winning goal by winning the free kick from which wayne rooney scored .
raheem sterling told england boss roy hodgson he was feeling tired ahead of the estonia game .
sterling spent the first half of the game on the bench before coming on during the second half .
but murphy believes hodgson would have been better to keep the conversation between him and sterling to himself .
' i think roy will regret putting it out there , ' murphy said on talksport .
' i think he -lsb- hodgson -rsb- could have just maybe taken it on the chin and said , ` i thought i 'd give him a little breather ' , rather than put it on the lad .
` he would n't have intentionally put it on him to create this , but i think roy could have dealt with it differently .
sterling played his part in england 's win as he won the free kick that wayne rooney scored from .
danny murphy won nine caps for england and worked with hodgson during his time at fulham .
` i 'm very surprised and if roy could turn back the clock , i do n't think he would do it and say it the way he did because he has caused raheem a problem and he would n't want to do that .
' and murphy , who won nine caps for england , does not believe that sterling deserves to be criticised for admitting he was tired .
he added : ` the way he plays , with that power and that speed , he gives everything and he needs to be on top of his game , '' he continued .
` if he is genuinely tired and he was honest for the team , then fair play to him .
` let 's not make it
