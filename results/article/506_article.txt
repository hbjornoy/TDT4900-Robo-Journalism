itv world cup viewers may have to put up with advert breaks during matches after broadcasters were given the chance to cash in on the mid-half water break .
three-minute breaks after 30 minutes of each half will be implemented if the temperature is forecast to be above 32 degrees at kick-off .
and the daily mirror reports that adverts are set to be screened during this break which will likely infuriate football fans .
