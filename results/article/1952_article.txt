the final product : maryland mother michelle cohn made butter using nothing but her own breast milk .
ms cohn , who has a 16-month-old daughter , shared the simple process she used .
the idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born .
' i needed to make sure that i kept my milk production up , ' she says .
` so i was hand expressing into a little container and then i remembered one time i was at a fair and they had a butter-making contest , where they had milk in jars and you shook it .
` so i wondered if you could do that with breast milk .
i looked it up online and sure enough , you could and i did it .
' sole ingredient : ms cohn started with a container filled with her own breast milk .
more volume : she then moved it to a larger container , and continued to add milk .
she says the first time she tried it , she used about two ounces of milk , and after she shook it for about 45 minutes , the first butter began to form .
she shook it for another 15 minutes , which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean .
` the next day , i put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and i added to that the next day , but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and i started shaking .
and that time , within about two minutes , i had butter , ' she says .
ms cohn says the result was ` not all that different from regular butter .
' solid goal : after vigorous shaking for 45 minutes , the butter began to form
