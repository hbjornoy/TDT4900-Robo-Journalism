` i 'm always coming up with different and wacky ideas .
this just popped into my head one morning .
` radina was the first person i spoke to , she thought the idea was excellent and said , `` go ahead and do it '' .
` she does n't mind if there 's random strangers at our wedding .
` the only twist is the strangers have to bid for the chance to come .
` the other guests love the idea .
i do n't think they really care at all , if they are any random strangers .
they are quite fun and outgoing people and they think the idea is brilliant .
they said to definitely go for something big and wacky .
