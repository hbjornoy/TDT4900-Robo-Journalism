peter pan 's opening line of ` all children , except one , grow up ' , is the nation 's most memorable .
peter pan is the book with the nation 's favourite opening line , according to a new poll .
` all children , except one , grow up , ' wrote jm barrie in his children 's classic which scooped 20per cent of the vote in a poll commissioned to mark world book day next month .
but it 's not just childhood fairytales that adults have fond memories of , as the opening lines from classic 19th century novel a tale of two cities by charles dickens came second place , while george orwell 's 1984 completed the top three .
however , the first words of 50 shades of grey did little to inspire as just one in 20 -lrb- five per cent -rrb- were wooed by el james ' opening line .
one in five of those polled admitted they will put a book down if the first line is n't engaging .
however , one in four -lrb- 25per cent -rrb- said they will continue reading a novel to the end even if they do n't enjoy it and , with complete disregard for the opening line , 15per cent admit jumping to the last chapter first to find out a book 's ending .
when it comes to reading with their children , one in eight parents -lrb- 12per cent -rrb- say youngsters will switch off if a book does n't capture their imagination quickly , and one in 10 are forced to adopt the characters ' voices to make reading more enjoyable .
parents know when they deserve an oscar , as one in seven children -lrb- 14per cent -rrb- will enjoy a book so much that they will read it again and 21per cent of people admit they 've used a line from a book as their own in order to impress a member of the opposite sex .
the poll was commissioned by asda .
laura grooby , asda 's book buyer , said : ` first impressions are everything , and even though hundreds of new books are released every week , it is clear the nation never forgets a famous opening line .
` this year , we hope by encouraging everyone to pick up and
