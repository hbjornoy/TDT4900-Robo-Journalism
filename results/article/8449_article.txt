` we tried to have them contact family but they do n't have anyone close .
there were no co-workers , no one who could help them out .
' rather than giving the couple a ticket , the officers decided on a different tact .
` we spoke with each other and made the decision to go get them a car seat so we 'd know the kid was safe and that this issue would n't come up again , ' hodges said .
the two men pooled their money and , while pavlige stayed with the family , hodges went to a local walmart to buy a new car seat for the baby .
they installed the seat and showed the shocked couple how to use it .

the two officers did n't tell anyone about their good deed , which they carried out in february , but it came to light
