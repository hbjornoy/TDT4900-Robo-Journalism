oliver sherwood has refused to rule out a shot at next month 's grand national with many clouds .
` if you had told me at the start of the season he would be sixth in the gold cup i would have bitten your hand off but my gut feeling is he did n't run his race .
he jumped off sixth and finished sixth .
he was beaten with a circuit to go .
` the winner -lrb- coneygree -rrb- is a very good horse .
like other trainers are saying about their runners , maybe he got us out of our comfort zone .
' meanwhile , amateur rider tom weston , who was airlifted to bristol 's southmead hospital after puncturing both lungs in a heavy fall from benbane head in last thursday 's fulke walwyn kim muir challenge cup was expected to be released from hospital on tuesday afternoon .
the amateur jockey , who had a spell in intensive care , tweeted : ` about to be let out to rest up at home .
big thanks to @ijf - official @cheltenhamraces @northbristolnhs and all wellwishers .
