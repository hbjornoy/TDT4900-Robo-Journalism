lord justice fulford has been cleared of any allegations of misconduct by the judicial conduct investigations office .
a top judge who founded a campaign group which helped leaders of the paedophile information exchange in 1979 has been exonerated by the judicial conduct investigations office .
an investigation was launched in march when the mail on sunday revealed appeal court judge and privy counsellor lord justice fulford , at the time a young barrister , set up an organisation called conspiracy against public morals .
the group campaigned against conspiracy charges faced by pie leaders .
but lord justice fulford has now been cleared of any allegations of misconduct .
the judge sparked anger earlier this year by slashing the prison sentence of a primary school deputy who hoarded films of the sadistic abuse of young children .
stephen horn , 34 , admitted viewing child pornography over 13 years and downloading 20 hours of sickening footage .
he was jailed for 18 months in december and banned from having unsupervised contact with any child under 16 .
horn appealed the severity of his jail term which was reduced to ten months by three high court judges including justice fulford .
the senior judge and two colleagues ruled that horn had not breached his trust as a teacher because his crimes did not involve his pupils .
they also said the sexual offences prevention order which banned him from unsupervised contact with children was unfair .
the judges also quashed the # 100 victim surcharge and said it had been unlawfully imposed because some of horn 's crimes happened before it came into force .
in their judgement judge fulford and his two colleagues ruled : ` none of the offences involved a breach of trust as a teacher .
