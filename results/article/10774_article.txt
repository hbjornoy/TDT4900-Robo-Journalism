google has had to apologise for accidentally wiping the small scottish island of jura from its maps service .
when users search for the island all that appears is a red outline , pictured where the mass of land should be .
bbc news was the first site to notice that the mass of land had vanished .
it is visible on google earth and on the satellite view of google maps , yet when the page is switched to maps view , the island disappears .
jura is part of scotland 's inner hebrides archipelago and is situated in between islay and the kintyre peninsula off the west coast of the uk country .
it only has around 200 residents that live in an area of approximately 140 square miles .
the island is renowned for its whisky and its deer , which outnumber the people 25 to one .
it is only accessible by a small ferry that stops running at 18.30 , small boats from colonsay to loch tarbert or by water taxi .
this ordnance survey map shows what the isle of jura should look like .
google apologised for the mishap and said its engineers were ` beavering away ' to fix it .
a google spokesman told the bbc : ` we are sorry about that .

` we hope to have the map of jura back to normal as soon as possible .
