for the millions of commuters on the new york city subway with their eyes glued permanently to their smartphones they 'll have something else to look at this month for a change .
an ad campaign launched earlier this month by the mta features humorous signs displaying proper subway etiquette .
` clipping ?
primping ?
everyone wants to look their best , but it 's a subway car , not a restroom , ' reads one of the signs which show an illustration of commuters using the subway car as their personal powder room .

do n't brush it off : signs as part of a new mta ad campaign break down subway etiquette for commuters .
hold the pole do n't ride it !
: signs show new york city subway riders what to do and what not to do .
not showtime : signs instruct commuters not to do what these performing teens are doing in the subway car .
another sign targeted performers on the subway who oftentimes use the poles in the car as their personal jungle gym , reports dna info .
` poles are for your safety .
not your latest routine , ' the ad reads .
` hold the pole , not our attention .
a subway car is no place for showtime , ' it continues .
another sign was aimed at subway passengers who sit with their legs widely spread open .
` dude .
stop the spread , please , ' said one of the signs which began popping up last friday .
one sign had a message for the subway hoarder who likes to let their stuff sprawl out every which way .
the mta has said that 2,600 subway cars will have the ads and they will create signs for the long island railroad and metro-north railroad as well .
boundaries : this sign tells subway passengers to keep their stuff to themselves and not on top of others .
say it do n't spread it : the mta has also taken on ` manspreading ' in an effort to convince men to make room for more riders .
train not tray : smelly , messy food is also the target of the mta 's new courtesy campaign .
