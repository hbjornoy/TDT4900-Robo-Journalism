a mother-of-two feared she would go blind when her face dramatically ballooned after she used piz buin sun cream .
joanna stockton , 36 , claims the lotion should be pulled from the shelves because her face swelled so much her eyes could not open following a severe allergic reaction .
her problems started within 48 hours of using the piz buin cream on holiday with her family , which left her blind in one eye .
frightened : joanna stockton says piz buin made her face swell up like this , leaving her unable to see out of one eye .
she was in majorca with her husband and two young children aged five and three , and had to have steroid injections to bring the swelling under control .
mrs stockton , from stansted , essex , said she was terrified she would go completely blind and had to stay inside for a week until the swelling went down .
` it was incredibly frightening .
i bought the sun cream as a health product to protect my skin , but it actually made it worse , ' she said .
' i applied the lotion on the first day of my holiday and when i woke the next morning there were red itchy bumps over my arms and legs , a bit like a nettle rash .
` the rash got worse and worse and a day later my head was so swollen my eyes had become slits , it was horrendous .
' mrs stockton said she had an anti-histamine to try and control the swelling , but it had no effect and by tea time that day one eye had completely closed .
` my whole face was throbbing and i was frightened i would go completely blind , ' she said .
' i lost all the features on my face and could n't smile or move my mouth properly .
' getting better : the 36-year-old had to have steroid injections to bring the swelling under control in spain .
