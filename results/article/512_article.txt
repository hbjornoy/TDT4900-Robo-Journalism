two of the biggest clubs in the aviva premiership on saturday night distanced themselves from saracens ' call to scrap the salary cap and admitted they could not afford it .
saracens , who are facing a premier rugby investigation into alleged breaches of the # 5.5 million cap , claimed to have the support of six other clubs .
but leicester and northampton , two of the most financially viable clubs , made it clear they are not interested .
leicester director of rugby richard cockerill is a firm believer in the current premiership wage structure .
northampton boss jim mallinder -lrb- above -rrb- shares cockerill 's view on the current salary cap restrictions .
leicester director of rugby richard cockerill said : ` the cap 's a good thing because it keeps the league competitive .
` sides like ourselves , gloucester , saints pay our own bills and have a sound financial structure that means we spend what we can afford to .
that 's a good model to be part of .
you 'd like it to be loosened a bit for europe but if you have a couple of sides that can spend # 15m it makes the league uneven .
` we can only afford to spend what we 've got .
we 're not in debt and that 's how we want to stay .
' northampton boss jim mallinder said : ` we could n't go up to # 10-15m .
i 've no interest in scrapping it .
you 'd have to asked the chief executives if they 'd be prepared to spend more money .
i 'd guess the answer is `` no '' .
' saracens chief executive , edward griffiths , has called for an end to the salary cap in the aviva premiership .
