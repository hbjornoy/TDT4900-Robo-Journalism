joe kinan lost his girlfriend and 40 per cent of his skin when the station nightclub in west warwick , rhode island caught fire during a concert in february 2003 .
kinan was the most injured survivor of the fire , with third and fourth degree burns covering nearly half of his body .
he also lost his hands , ears , the sight in his left eye and much of his nose tissue .
so far , he has had 120 surgeries .
while some would let such blows get the better of them - kinan remained positive and that attitude has clearly paid off .
at the world burn congress in providence rhode island this week , kinan announced that he had fallen in love with another burn victim , and that they are engaged .

' they first started out as friends , but eventually grew to be something more .
aftermath : the fire at the station nightclub was the fourth most deadly nightclub fire in u.s. history , killing 100 .
