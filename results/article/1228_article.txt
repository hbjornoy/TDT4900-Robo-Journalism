liverpool are giving serious consideration to making a move for chelsea defender ryan bertrand as brendan rodgers attempts to fill the club 's troublesome left-back position .
bertrand is ready to leave stamford bridge this summer in search of regular first-team football after nine years with the club .
liverpool manager rodgers is a long-term admirer of bertrand after working with him previously at the chelsea academy and the 24-year-old has emerged as a serious alternative to sevilla 's alberto moreno .

solution : liverpool are considering making a bid for chelsea left-back ryan bertrand .
problem position : liverpool manager brendan rodgers has struggled to fill his left-back role .
the spanish left-back was one rodgers ' principal targets at the beginning of the summer but liverpool are reluctant to meet sevilla 's asking price , after they demanded a deal in excess of # 20million for the 21-year-old defender .
bertrand , who spent the second half of last season on loan at aston villa , would be rather more affordable at around # 8m and the player is understood to be keen on a move to a club playing champions league football .
liverpool endured major difficulties at left-back last season following the injury to jose enrique and the disappointing form of aly cissokho , although john flanagan did impress in the final few months of the season .
rodgers will also step up his pursuit of southampton 's croatian defender dejan lovren , with a # 15m bid expected to be lodged in the coming weeks .
alternative : bertrand is a possibility if liverpool can not sign sevilla left-back alberto moreno -lrb- right -rrb- .
