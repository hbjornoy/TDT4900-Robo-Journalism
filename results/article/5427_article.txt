rant : ukip 's robert ray argued with police officers after being caught drink-driving in a hotel car park .
a ukip councillor launched a 2am drunken tirade at police after attending a fundraiser with nigel farage and declared : ` do you know who i am ?
' robert ray , 65 , was caught drink-driving by the officers in the car park of a four-star essex hotel where he had been socialising with the party leader .
ray has apologised after he was fined # 600 and handed a 19-month driving ban - but insisted he was only moving the car to help his collapsed wife .
a court heard she died three months later , although it was not explained whether her death and the car park collapse were linked .
the councillor , who previously made headlines when he was outed as a 1977 national front candidate , was at the orsett hall country hotel last june in thurrock , essex , where he sits a borough councillor .
basildon magistrates ' court heard staff advised him not to drive in his drunken state before calling police when they saw ray walk towards his silver peugeot 406 in the car park .
it led to an angry confrontation which ended in ray being breathalysed and recording a score of 75mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than twice the drink-drive limit of 35mg .
samantha doyle , prosecuting , said : ` the officers told him they had received a call and asked him if he had been drinking .
he told them he `` had had a couple '' .
` mr ray then became agitated and gestured at the officers and shouted that he had been at an event with nigel farage , adding : `` do you know who i am ?
i am a prominent person and a councillor .
i am a powerful man .
'' ray refused to take a breathalyser test and was arrested as his wife lay ill at the side of the car .
miss doyle added : ` mr ray told them he was n't on the road , but he was told if he did n't consent to a breath test he would be arrested .
he refused - the time was 2.15 am .
` mr ray was ranting and raving and
