sportsmail 's riath al-samarrai tries his hand at interpreting .
liverpool star raheem sterling gave a revealing insight into his liverpool talks with bbc sport .
what he said : ` i would never want the fans to think bad of me , to think i just want as much money for myself .
i want them to understand it 's been a bit much for me this season , with everyone talking about it every minute .
' what he meant : ca n't a guy just let his contract run down in peace ?
what he said : ` it 's never been about money .
i talk about winning trophies throughout my career .
that 's all i talk about .
' what he meant : finishing the season empty-handed wo n't help the situation .
sterling says it is not about money , only about trophies - so can liverpool afford to not win any this season ?
what he said : ` i do n't talk about how many cars i 'm going to drive , how many houses i 've got .
i just purely want to be the best i can be .
' what he meant : if you 're wondering , i drive a mercedes c63 and also have a range rover 4x4 .
they are both white .
what he said : ` you really want to be working with world-class players day in , day out .
it 's obviously left a little dent , these two world-class superstars -lrb- suarez and gerrard -rrb- leaving , but i think we have good players coming through at liverpool .
' what he meant : : players come and go .
deal with it .
sterling rejected liverpool 's contract offer of # 100,000-a-week and says he is focusing on his football .
what he said : on speculation that arsenal are keen : ` quite flattering .
