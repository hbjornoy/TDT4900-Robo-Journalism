sporting director piero ausilio insists inter would reject bids of # 30million for their star striker icardi .
` what if someone bids $ 40m -lrb- # 30m -rrb- for him in the summer ?
, ' ausilio told sky sport .
` well we 've got no intention of doing business , we 're thinking of the present and future of this football club with icardi .
` our intentions are clear .
we 're building a team to last for a long time with very talented , young players .
` as well as mateo kovacic and icardi , we 've added more quality players such as marcelo brozovic and xherdan shaqiri and we want to continue in this vein .

ausilio claims that icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract at inter , the club he joined back in 2013 .
ausilio also confirmed that icardi is close to signing a new contract at the san siro , giving the club more power when it comes to keeping him out of the clutches of premier league clubs .

icardi will remain with us for much longer .
