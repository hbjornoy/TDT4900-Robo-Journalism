while i feel there are plenty of modern bowlers who would be just as at home chucking darts at the ally pally as performing at lord 's , i do feel sachithra senanayake is a victim of a haphazard and slightly unfair system .
i 'd rather see anyone with a suspect action being put on notice and monitored in match situations instead of being sent to the laboratory .
tell them they 're being watched and get them to bowl in short-sleeved shirts so the umpires can see exactly what they need to .
if umpires continue to report any bowler , then they clearly have a case .
a victim ?
sri lanka 's sachithra senanayake has been reported but is not the only bowler with a suspect action .
i am thrilled by the response of many english batsmen to the opportunities in international cricket this season and it will be fascinating to see who the new panel of selectors go for when they name their first test team .
there 's one name i have n't seen mentioned much but which really should be in the frame .
adam lyth is the best i 've seen this season .
he 's solid , unflappable and confident and if i were england i would get this yorkie in .
you know what they say about a strong yorkshire ?
if you do n't , they 'll soon tell you .
lyth spirit : yorkshire opener adam lyth should be talked about for england .
