an eight-year-old abuse survivor , who was beaten so severely as an infant that she permanently lost the use of her legs , has written a heartwrenching open letter to her social workers and detectives thanking them for investigating her case and placing her in a happy home where she is loved .
marie surprenant , from atlanta , georgia , was eight-months-old and weighed only 14lbs when she was admitted to the children 's healthcare of atlanta with more than 14 fractures , numerous bruises and a spinal cord injury that left her paraplegic .
after her biological mother and her boyfriend were arrested , marie was placed into foster care and later adopted by michele surprenant .
' i want to thank you for making me happy by giving me a new warm and safe environment , ' marie began her handwritten letter , which was published on children 's healthcare of atlanta 's blog .
` now i have a home that is nice and i have three nice meals a day .
' all smiles : abuse survivor marie surprenant was photographed with her adoptive mother michele during a trip to the beach .
marie , who was recently accepted into one of the city 's top private schools for the fourth grade , went on to introduce herself and tell her story .
` when i was a baby i got hurt and you were on my case , ' she wrote .
` when i was little i got hurt and i was n't going to walk at all .
' marie wrote a detailed account of how her biological mother 's boyfriend lied in the emergency room about how she got her injuries , claiming that she fell out of bed .
she noted that because her social workers ` got involved and solved ' her case the ` bad guy ' is no longer hurting her - or anyone else .
' i think that if you never helped me my life would still be awful and lonely .
because they might not help me , not feed me or they would hit me when i cried ' she said .
` but now i 'm much better .
i now have a safe happy environment .
i am also around smart people .
