the first step has been made in the inevitable disqualification of saturday 's badger beer chase winner the young master with the bha lodging an objection to the result .
arrangements are being made to hold a disciplinary hearing on thursday when runner-up court by surprise is expected to be promoted .
the young master was an effortless winner of the # 60,000 wincanton race but it later emerged that he was not eligible to run .
a computer error allowed the young master to enter and win the badger beer chase while being ineligible .
race conditions stated that a novice must have previously contested three chases and the young master had only run in two .
the bha confirmed that their initial investigations have shown a ` computer systems error ' was responsible for the young master 's entry being accepted .
but it also suggested the horse 's trainer , neil mulholland , may face some censure for his part in the episode .
the statement said : ` it remains the trainer 's responsibility to ensure a horse is not declared for a race for which it is not qualified .
' the enquiry will also decide whether the young master should carry a penalty should he take up an entry at cheltenham on friday and whether his handicap mark should be adjusted even if he is stripped of the prize .
trainer neil mulholland could face some sort of punishment following a disciplinary hearing .
it has been a bad two weeks for british jumps racing .
race times suggest the distance of the charlie hall chase run at wetherby the previous weekend may have been shorter than advertised .
officials were yesterday measuring the yorkshire track , which races again on saturday , and the results are expected on tuesday .
the bha will be praying the treble does n't come up with a disaster at the weekend 's big cheltenham fixture .
