steakhouses around the world are well-known for touting their authenticity .
but this russian restaurant went the extra mile to show off their chargrilling process by setting an entire billboard on fire .
these dramatic images show the moment the stunt promoting the food at double grill and bar , in the city of yekaterinburg , got underway .
scroll down for video .
hot topic : the billboard , advertising char-grilled steaks , was set on fire at night to create authentic burn marks .
passers-by had spent the previous day , in november , bemused by a large photograph of a raw steak , accompanied by no branding or advertising information .
but one night , a pair of men dressed in chef outfits and armed with a flamethrower set the billboard alight along eight lines , mimicking the effects of a flame-grilling .
before : the billboard began its life as an otherwise unmarked photograph of a slab of beef .
bringing the fire : two men dressed as chefs used a flamethrower to set the board alight .
though the board was only alight for a matter of seconds before the fire was extinguished , the aftermath left realistic-looking char marks along the meat - giving the illusion that it had been grilled .
although the trails of smoke emanating from the billboard soon faded , the ` cooked ' piece of meat was visible to pedestrians and drivers the next day .
the transformed ad also had the details of the double grill and bar restaurant revealed so intrigued viewers could try out the steaks for themselves .
extinguisher : after the flames had burned for a short while , the men put out the billboard using fire extinguishers .
well done : after the flames had disappeared , authentic-looking whisps of smoke still drifted from the billboard .
taking the credit : after the stunt , a panel was revealed showing the details of the restaurant .
