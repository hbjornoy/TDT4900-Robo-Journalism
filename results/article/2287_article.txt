as far as armed robbers go , james allan will not be remembered as a criminal mastermind .
in what can only be described as a farcical raid on a corner shop , he failed to ensure he had a foolproof disguise and a meticulously planned gateway .
for starters , he brandished a toy gun .
then , the dopey 28-year-old unveiled his disguise by whipping off his balaclava in full view of the shop 's cctv camera .
and that was before things went from bad to worse , as he struggled to exit via the one - way door .
scroll down to watch the cctv !
allan demands cash from the woman behind the till : he does n't take very much of it though .
he may as well have not worn the balaclava : not long after this scene is filmed allan takes it off in full view of cctv .
not only did staff know him as a regular customer , he had also robbed the place just 10 days earlier .
allan 's embarrassing catalogue of errors started shortly after he burst into martin 's newsagent in abingdon , oxon , waving the plastic gun .
amazingly , in the pantomime-style raid , he did manage to grab # 134.98 from the till .
as he attempted to leave the shop , allan , who was pushing instead of pulling the door , then attempted to kick out the glass panel but toppled backwards into a drinks display , sending bottles skidding across the floor .
baffled store manager angela croke , keen to see the back of him , even went to his aid and helped him leave the store on march 2 this year .
allan was picked up by police just three hours after his botched robbery , still on the same street and with his balaclava stuffed in his pocket .
when bundled into the police car he burst into tears and said to officers , ` i 'm sorry , it 's not fair on them - are they all right ?
' allan was jailed for three years for this offence last month but new details can only now
