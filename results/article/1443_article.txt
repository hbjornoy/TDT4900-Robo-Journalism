google is facing fresh outrage over its meagre contribution to the uk taxman , after revealing it paid just # 20million in corporation tax last year .
the california-based internet giant has faced stinging criticism for using a complex corporate structure that allows it to route uk sales through ireland to slash its tax bill .
and the scheme appears to have again paid off .
luck has nothing to do with it : google has managed to slash its uk tax bill to just # 20million .
last night it revealed in accounts filed to companies house that it paid # 20.4 million in taxes last year -- despite admitting earlier this year that it pulls in # 3.3 billion of revenues in britain , largely from advertising .
but in accounts filed last night google uk said it made a profit of # 70.8 million before tax on sales of # 642million .
these numbers are artificially low because google officially registers much of its british sales in ireland , where the headline rate of corporation tax is 12.5 per cent compared with 21 per cent in the uk .
and the internet behemoth is then able to slash its bill even further by siphoning cash out of ireland by paying royalties to another firm based in the tax haven of bermuda .
` deeply disappointed ' : ed miliband 's on google 's tax-avoidance policy when it came to light last year .
google 's aggressive tax avoidance policy has sparked criticism from campaign groups and politicians including ed miliband .
the labour leader last year declared himself ` deeply disappointed ' that google , which employs almost 2,000 people in the uk , is able to get away with paying so little tax .
google has defended itself by pointing to its record of employing people in the uk and investing more than # 300million in london property .
but france has moved to crack down on the company , slapping it with a tax bill of nearly # 800million earlier this year after raiding its paris offices .
