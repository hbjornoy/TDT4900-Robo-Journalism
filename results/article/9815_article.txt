for years , all butch the boston terrier knew was a life of roaming the streets , rifling through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal .
but for one week , he got to experience unwavering love thanks to alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas , who found him in pinson , alabama and threw him a party before he was put to sleep .
as a puppy , the terrier had an owner and a home but , after a couple of years , the owner cast the dog out and he was left to live in the streets , al.com reported .
he lived off scraps and found shelter from the frost , but a week before thanksgiving , buzbee and her daughter discovered him lying in a front yard , struggling to breathe .

loved : alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas found butch , a homeless and dying boston terrier , the week before thanksgiving and lavished him with attention for a few days until he had to be put down .
celebration : they threw butch a ` farewell ' party where he met santa paws and opened gifts .
joy : the pup , who had been abandoned by his owner years ago , dons a cute hat for his party .
they took him to a veterinarian at the birmingham boston terrier rescue and learned that he had almost no lung capacity , his trachea was leaking and his heart was swollen .
the vet suggested he be scheduled for a ` humane euthanasia ' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog .
for a few blissful days over thanksgiving , he feasted on burgers and pumpkin pie , enjoyed playing with new toys and relished in the attention from his temporary owners .
then they threw him an early christmas ` going away ' party , where he sat on santa 's lap and donned a party hat as he opened more gifts .
care : the dog , who had a swollen heart , experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life .
treats : butch , pictured with kansas and friends left , took trips to petsmart for new toys and treats .
at home : butch , pictured grinning with kansas ,
