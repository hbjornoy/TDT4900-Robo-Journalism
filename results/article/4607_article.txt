criminals are being locked up for longer as the government keeps its promise to be tough on those who break the law , new figures show .
convictions of celebrity sex abusers are believed to be partly responsible for a larger number of sex offenders being prosecuted , as victims feel more confident about coming forward to expose their abusers .
the average jail term now stands at 15Â 1/2 months , three months longer than the average in 2004 , and prisoners are getting longer sentences now than they have done for 20 years , ministry of justice moj -rrb- figures reveal .

' the average custodial sentence length -lrb- acsl -rrb- , or length of time people are sentenced to , has increased year on year over the last decade , according to the moj 's new criminal justice statistics update .
the new figures , which do n't include life or indeterminate sentences , show that while fines are the most commonly given punishment by all courts , offenders who are sent to jail are facing a longer period inside , particularly sex offenders .
criminals jailed for sex offences are jailed for longer than any others , with an average sentence of 58.7 months .
the custody rate for these offenders is also up , with 60 per cent of those convicted of sex offenders being sent to prison , second only to robbers , of whom 64 per cent are jailed .

in the last year alone , celebrity publicist max clifford , broadcaster stuart hall and former children 's television presenter rolf harris have all been jailed for sex offences .
in july , rolf harris was jailed for five years and nine months after being found
