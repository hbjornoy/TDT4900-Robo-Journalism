ignored : nurse june thornton saw jimmy savile abuse a patient in her bed but says her complaint was ` shrugged off ' by nhs staff .

upset : mrs thornton , who enjoyed a long medical career in york said yesterday 's report was ` too little too late ' ` that nurse knew , people in the hospital knew , people everywhere knew - but nobody did anything about it , and it is a real tragedy .
' i can just see it now , the way he touched that girl right in front of me , without a care that i was even watching .
' she added : ` all we are doing now is proving how bad jimmy savile was , but so many people at the time knew exactly what he was up to and that is so frustrating .
' mrs thornton even says she wishes that savile had tried to molest her in the ward , as she would have ` screamed the place down ' .
' i wish he would have assaulted me , ' she said .
' i would have screamed the hospital down and made absolutely sure something was done about it .
