target : lauren silverman has made a steady rise up the social ladder .
to borrow the vernacular of the high-powered wall street banking circles in which she now moves , lauren silverman bears the look of someone who has ` bagged the elephant ' .
after all , the prospect of being the mother to simon cowell 's first child will , one imagines , open many doors in the glitzy social strata she has made it her business to frequent , not to mention access to the x factor mogul 's # 225million fortune .
certainly florida-born lauren gives every indication of knowing exactly where she is going : upwards .
friends in the us describe her as ` determined and ambitious ' .
which , depending on whom you believe , could be a euphemism for a gold digger who 'll let nothing and nobody stop her rise to notoriety and money .
whatever the case , there are a couple of spanners in the works .
last night sources close to cowell were making it plain that he has no intention of marrying her .
one of his friends said : ` simon and lauren are in a relationship , they are very happy -- she 's been good for him .
they are a couple and simon will just pay for their child .
he will step up and be a part of the life of the child ... but simon is saying privately that he has absolutely no plans to marry lauren .
' then there is the small matter of the fact she is still married to her banker and property developer husband of ten years , andrew silverman .
but not for much longer .
a furious silverman has filed divorce papers in new york which name cowell as her lover and accuse his wife of ` cruel and inhuman treatment ' .
the prospect of an imminent divorce is , no doubt , a relief to 37-year-old mr silverman 's highly respectable and wealthy parents , .
eleonora and allen .
they were said to be so aghast at their son 's choice .
of bride that they refused to attend the wedding in
