erik lamela -lrb- centre -rrb- scores a stunning rabona goal from 20 yards out in tottenham 's 5-1 europa league win .
lamela celebrates after his wondergoal against asteras tripolis at white hart lane on thursday night .
the argentinian hopes the goal , which he says is the best of his life , will kick-start his tottenham career .
the south american has failed to hit the heights expected of him since his club record # 30million arrival from roma last summer .
but he hopes his brilliantly executed strike can be the catalyst for bigger and better things .
` was it the best goal of my life ?
yes , i think so .
i think so .
` i 've scored like that before , when i was playing in the junior sides at river plate .
it just happened in a flash .
' i was n't thinking about doing something like that , i just wanted to score and it was the most effective , comfortable way of making it happen .
lamela -lrb- right -rrb- bagged a second with an excellently executed left-foot volley which flew past tomas kosicky .
the 22-year-old has had a slow start to his tottenham career since his # 30million move from roma in 2013 .
` it 's something i 'll always remember because it 's something different from the other goals i 've scored .
` the goal can help me show my best here .
it was important for me but also because i needed to score , any type of goal .
` i 'm happy for the goal and the win .
i hope to continue in this way but it 's just one game for me .
i need to think about doing other things well and continuing to improve .
