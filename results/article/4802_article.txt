sergio ramos is preparing to face belarus on saturday .
speaking to marca radio , ramos said : ` it can create some doubt .
not only among teammates , but among the supporters .
issues like these spark debate .
' i would n't have allowed that because i would have gone out to talk about it and clarify the issue a bit so that it did n't get blown out of proportion and so that people knew the problem .
it 's better to set the record straight so that people ca n't speculate and make it up .
diego costa celebrates scoring the winner for chelsea after being left out of the spain squad .
` it 's difficult to set rules , there always needs to be an element of tact on matters like these .
i think it 's better as long as it does n't give a false impression to the fans and your teammates .
` i 'd like to see all players having the same commitment with the selection as they have with their clubs .
ramos says manager vicente del bosque has to be left to make the decisions .
` i think we have to transmit this commitment to all the new players who come for the first time .
at the end of the day that 's what makes the difference , it 's what makes success whether your club pays you or your national team .
' spain are currently second in their qualification group , three points behind leaders slovakia and are level on points with ukraine .
