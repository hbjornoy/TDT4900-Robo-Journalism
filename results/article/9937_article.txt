and she loves it .
she 's no baloney !
alexandra longo , miss addison , chicago , was recruited for the wienermobile at college .
swapping pageantry for fast food : she said she did n't realize how exciting and interesting the job would be .
` my initial thought was that i did n't go to college so i could hand out hot dogs for the rest of my life , but that 's not what this job is about , ' she told the chicago tribune .
she started with driving lessons , getting to grips with the enormous wheeled sausage .
then it was on the road for longo .
with her colleagues , she has toured across the north and midwest - and even pitched up in times square , new york .
crowned : this is the moment in 2010 that longo , who plans to work in public relations , won her title .
on father 's day , she surprised her parents by parking the wienermobile outside their house .
` if we park at the front of the parking lot -lsb- at a store -rsb- people think there 's an event going on , ' she told the tribune .
` as my boss tells me : `` you ca n't sneak in anywhere in a 27-foot-long hot dog .
'' ' ecstatic though she is , longo plans to sideline hot dogs this june to pursue a job in personal relations , having studied journalism at college .
