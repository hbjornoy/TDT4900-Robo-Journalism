a chinese man has taken his desire for a quiet life to the extreme by living as a hermit in a cave for the past 20 years .
feng mingshan , 54 , has to climb a 50 metre vertical cliff to reach the entrance of his unusual home where he has even fashioned a front door and hung curtains .
feng moved out of gaoba town , in northwest china 's shaanxi province , in 1993 because he did not want to be around other people .

local media reported that feng originally found the cave when he was just a boy .
` it was a small cave when i found it , and i expanded it to its current size using a hammer ' , he was quoted by the mirror as saying .

he added : ' i also cleared the path through the ravine .
summer is cool here and it 's good .
' residents in nearby villages said he normally leaves the cave at night but can still make the steep ascent with ease .
