this is the astonishing moment a polish man solved a rubik 's cube in just 21.17 seconds -- while blindfolded .
marcin kowalczyk set a new world record in the same amount of time that it takes most people to make a few turns and become frustrated with the 3-d combination puzzle .
but what makes it so remarkable is the fact that marcin accomplished his incredible feat without seeing what his hands were doing .
marcin kowalczyk studies the rubik 's cube to memorise its pattern for the world record attempt .
the speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the rubik 's cube and then , while blindfolded , he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in szczecin in western poland .
a judge held a piece of paper between marcin 's face and his hands to make sure he could n't peek under his mask .
his celebration was subdued , however , as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle .

marcin leaps out of his chair and hugs the judge after solving the rubik 's cube in just 21.17 seconds .
this is n't the first time marcin has set a world record with his special talent .
he was already the record holder with a time of 23.19 seconds , which he set earlier this year .
in november 2013 he solved 41 rubik 's cubes in 54 minutes and 14 seconds while blindfolded .
he studied all 41 cubes and memorised their patterns before putting on a blindfold and solving each one .
