in 1963 , then-12-year-old dennis komsa wrote a note on a piece of paper , put it in a glass mason jar and hurled it into the atlantic ocean near sampson avenue in seaside heights , new jersey , hoping it would some day be returned to him .
in november of 2012 , nearly 50 years after komsa tossed his message in a bottle into the ocean , the bottle was found .

the note stanton recovered was dated saturday august 16 , 1963 , and had the following written on it in all capital letters : ` to whom it may concern , please fill out the following questions and
