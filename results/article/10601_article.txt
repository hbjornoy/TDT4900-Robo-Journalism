while most women dream of a traditional all white wedding , one long-suffering bride was given a black and yellow themed wedding - based on the the colour scheme of her husband-to-be 's favourite power tool brand .
carpenter john jones , 28 , is obsessed with dewalt drills , saws and sanders which are made only in black and yellow .
and when john proposed to sweetheart kelly williams he came up with the ultimate diy wedding - to show her the power of love .
team colours : kelly williams was given a black and yellow themed wedding , in honour of the colour of her new husband john jones ' favourite power tool brand .
john , his best man and three groomsmen wore black with yellow ties .
the two bridesmaids donned bright yellow dresses and the # 400 wedding cake was in black and yellow tiers with marzipan models of john and kelly on the top .
the 150 guests sat down for the wedding reception in a hall decked out in none other than black and yellow , and they all went home with black and yellow carpenter 's measuring tapes as wedding gifts .
kelly , 27 , gave her approval to john 's power tool wedding day but stuck to her guns and wore a traditional white gown .
she said : ` he 's mad about just one brand of power tools , he has been since the day i met him .
` when he came up with the idea i was n't too happy - black and yellow are not really traditional for a wedding .
original : the 150 guests sat down for the wedding reception in a hall decked out in black and yellow and the cake was made in his favourite colours too .
` but my chief bridesmaid said it would look original so i told him to go ahead .
` but i put my foot down when it came to my dress - that 's where i drew the line .
' john 's obsession started on his first day as an apprentice carpenter when he bought a set of dewalt tools .
he has since set up his own carpentry business and wears a black and yellow uniform in his black and yellow van .
