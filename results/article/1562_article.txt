the russian grand prix : organisers say it is the only track in the world to be located in an olympic venue .
it also serves as both a permanent and a street circuit given it integrates into sochi 's general infrastructure during non-racing periods .
mclaren star button said : ` it 's always interesting to visit new circuits .
` it 's fun to get out and explore the contours of the track , the kerbs , the run-offs , the camber .
` they 're all the things you do n't really fully experience until you 're on-site and able to see the track for the very first time .
that 'll be my priority on thursday .
' assessing the venue from what he has seen so far via a simulator , button added : ` from what i 've seen of the place it 's sort of a mix between the tracks we raced on in valencia and korea .

the brit says he expects the sochi track to be a mix between valencia and south korea .
` there are plenty of long , fast straights hemmed in by concrete walls and high barriers , and a selection of medium-speed corners that seem to have been designed to test the abilities of a car .
` as with all these new venues , they only really begin to unlock themselves once you get out on the track for the first time .
` i 've lost none of my enthusiasm for going to new places , so i 'll be keen to get out there on friday and get a feel for the place .
