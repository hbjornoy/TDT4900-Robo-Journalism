it is one thing offering somebody a helping hand .
but this man gave a lot more than he bargained for .
supporting his colleague in a training session as she prepared to be tasered , the us security squadron had no idea that he too would be struck with pain just seconds later .
as the woman is hit , she screams with pain and clutches the first thing she can get her hand on : his crotch .
scroll down for video .
reflex : without thinking , her hand flings down into her colleague 's crotch and squeezes as she is tasered .
caught off-guard , the airman strives to keep hold of his attacker as he bends over in pain - while the room erupts with laughter .
as the taser stops and the woman falls to the ground , he tumbles across the room groaning in agony .
the scene at mcconnell air force base in kansas was captured on august 8 last year by airman 1st class armando a schwier-morales , but until this week it has been kept under wraps .
in the monthly course , the recruits are trained to use and understand tasers before they can carry one .
as the tasered squadron screams , her colleague crumbles to the ground in agony , trying to keep hold of her .
out of the 40-strong classes , only a quarter of the students step up to feel the force for themselves .
sergeant gregory oglesby , who leads the training , said : ` it feels like you 've got electricity going through your body , you ca n't move .
` you actually feel it going through your nervous system and your muscles lock up .
