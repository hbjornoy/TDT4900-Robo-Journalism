emma-victoria houlton loves her food ; whether it 's a sunday roast with all the trimmings or an italian meal , she 's always happy to tuck in .
but just five years ago , emma , 29 , would have baulked at eating pasta , bread , pizza dough , potatoes and yorkshire puddings .
why ?
because , like thousands of others , she believed high-protein , low-carb regimes like the atkins or paleo diets were the most effective way to be slim .
diet damage : emma-victoria houlton , left , broke a bone in her foot due to calcium deficiency while brooke power , right , suffered migraines and dizziness during ten months on a low carb diet .
but , after cutting down on carbs so much that she would n't even eat dairy products as they contain lactose - a sugar - emma-victoria believes she has permanently damaged her health .
' i was only a size eight but found it hard to stay slim , ' she says .
` then , when i was 22 , i saw a documentary about the atkins diet , thought it was great and cut most carbs out of my diet .
` breakfast was an omelette , lunch was chicken with lettuce and dinner was something meaty with vegetables like kale , cabbage , sprouts or runner beans , which do n't contain starch .
' i got all the classic symptoms associated with a low-carb diet : dry mouth , tiredness , crankiness and bad breath .
but i saw great results - my 8st 7lb weight was much easier to maintain .
' unbelievably , emma-victoria , a creative director in manchester , stuck to the regime for three punishing years .
unbalanced : all protein and no carbs can upset the digestive system and cause muscle to be burnt for energy .
` at restaurants , every meal had to be steak and salad , ' she says .
` i 'd go to a friend 's house for dinner and if they 'd made pasta , i 'd eat a tiny amount , so as not to be rude , and end up feeling really ill - with chronic bloating and having to dash to the toilet .
' i decided to come off the diet
