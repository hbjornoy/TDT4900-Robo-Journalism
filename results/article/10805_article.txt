ever since david beckham was snapped running around los angeles in his underpants filming his new h&m campaign , the women of the world have been eagerly awaiting the results .
now they need wait no longer as today sees the launch of the new guy ritchie-directed tv advert - due to hit the small screen at 9.50 pm this evening .
the film kicks off with beckham waving goodbye to his three sons in his dressing gown , only for it to be shut in the door of the car .
scroll down for video .
oh pants !
beckham realises the car has driven off with his dressing gown shut in the door .
athletic : he sprints off in pursuit , vaulting over hedges and running through a tennis court in the process .
that 's torn it !
unfortunately for becks , cotton vests and hedges do n't mix well and the star is left topless .
stripped down : david makes a dash across a los angeles garden in his skimpy green boxers .
as the car drives off , the dressing gown is pulled away , leaving beckham clad only in a vest and tight pair of pants .
a chase ensues with beckham losing his vest -lrb- but not his slippers -rrb- in the process , thanks to some athletic hedge-vaulting and a dip in one of his neighbour 's pools .
unfortunately for becks , he does n't quite manage to catch up with his dressing gown and comes to a halt in front of a tour bus filled with japanese tourists , who , as one , whip out a phalanx of cameras .
beckham , 37 , is no stranger to modelling and has starred in campaigns for h&m , armani and police sunglasses - most of which have required him to remove his top .
but his latest campaign appears to be among his favourites , with the footballer singing the praises of director guy ritchie .
diver : while beckham might not be much of a diver on the field , he proves adept off it .
uh oh ... becks screeches to a halt , only to discover a bus
