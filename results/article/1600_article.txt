i do n't think it 's a pain you can heal .
it 's been with me for life .
she -lrb- denise -rrb- was devastated .
it just ripped us apart .
' ` you just try your best .
we had the best thing taken away from us .
it always comes back .
you still feel the same , but you learn to live with the pain .
i just feel like i should have had him at the time .
` i thought it would be alright - it was just kids who took him .
it felt like i was in a dream .
i could n't believe it .
they did n't just kill james .
they tortured him .
they mutilated him .
' he added : ` i was just killing myself .
sometimes i was drinking a bottle of whisky and could n't get drunk .
two bottles of whisky .
i tried to kill the pain .
it did n't work for me .
for years and years .
