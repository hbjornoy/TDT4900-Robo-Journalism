diego lopez 's transfer from real madrid to ac milan is '99 per cent ' complete , according to adriano galliani .
reports in italy suggested he had rejected offers from arsenal and liverpool to move to milan , who have also signed goalkeeper michael agazzi on a free transfer from chievo .
galliani , ac milan 's ceo and vice-president , told gazzetta dello sport : ` the deal for diego lopez has been 99 per cent completed .
' on the move : adriano galliani will move from real madrid to ac milan , with the deal being '99 per cent ' done .
lopez had played regularly at real since jose mourinho and iker casillas fell out when the portuguese manager was in charge .
but after madrid signed costa rican keeper keylor navas this summer it became clear the 32-year-old spaniard was surplus to requirements .
there had been some suggestions that iker casillas , madrid 's captain , would leave the club instead , but lopez 's transfer would put an end to that .
replacement : new signing keylor navas has meant that the 32-year-old lopez is now surplus to requirements .
although details of the deal have not been revealed , it is thought lopez will sign a four-year deal with the club .
ac milan manager pippo inzaghi said of his incoming signing : ` diego lopez is very important , ' ` he is an experienced goalkeeper and will improve our squad , ' lopez will be inzaghi 's sixth summer signing after the italians already brought in jeremy menez , alex , michael agazzi , michelangelo albertazzi and adil rami .
competition : iker casillas and diego lopez have been competing for the no1 spot at madrid for 18 months .
