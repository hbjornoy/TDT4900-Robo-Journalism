it 's official : missouri plumbers vote too .
jay nixon , the show-me state 's democratic governor , sent out an embarrassing tweet tuesday morning as voters queued up to cast their ballots , showing a woman seated at the polls with her butt-crack exposed .
` arse-n-all ' of democracy : missouri?s governor tweeted this photo of a voter , who may or may not be a plumber , at a polling place tuesday morning .
the guffaw-inducing gaffe quickly went viral , and staffers swapped out the image 19 minutes later .
` voting in #jcmo this morning , ' nixon tweeted , referring to the state 's capital , jefferson city .
` make sure to cast your ballot & make your voice heard #election2014 ' missouri is holding statewide elections for u.s. house seats , but neither nixon nor missouri 's u.s. senators are facing election fights .
reaction to the original tweet was fast and furious .
ballot ?
check .
pants tight ?
check .
gov. nixon voted on tuesday as aides snapped the hilarious photo , and later substituted this one on his twitter feed .
` plumbers have to vote too , y' know !
' one campaign consultant told mailonline .
` if you leave the polls open long enough in st. louis , eventually the moon comes out , ' wrote a blogger on a conservative-oriented email listserv .
another weighed in with crack -- pun intended -- about the ` arse-n-all ' of democracy .
nixon 's office did not respond for requests for comment .
mailonline is n't holding its breath , but it is checking the tightness of its belt .
