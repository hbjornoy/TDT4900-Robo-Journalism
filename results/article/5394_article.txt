berlin 's disaster airport ber - running millions in overspend and years behind schedule - has suffered a new embarrassing snag after management bosses admitted this week that they ca n't turn the lights off .
three hundred workers are employed at the biggest construction site in the country trying to put right the airport meant to be the most advanced in the world .
but no-one is able to cut the power to thousands of lights burning at least # 2,000 worth of electricity every 12 hours in the main terminal hall .
spot the problem : at least # 2,000 every 12 hours are thought to be being wasted on lights at ber airport .
directing traffic : some lights at the airport are obviously useful - but others are just draining money .
` we are not so far advanced that we can control the lighting , ' said horst amann , in charge of the technological side of the project which has made berlin a laughing stock .
` it is true that deficiencies in the control system currently affect the terminal lighting ' , said a spokesman for the airport company .
but he said the lights would be left on at night anyway ` for security reasons .
' berlin is currently served by two other airports , tegel and schoenefeld , both of which are now pouring millions into upgrades as most experts believe ber wo n't be operating until 2017 at the earliest .
ongoing saga : the airport is years behind schedule and has almost doubled its budget .
it was supposed to open last year .
the cost of the project has almost doubled from its original estimate - from # 1.7 bn to # 3.7 bn .
it is expected , when the problems are resolved and the airport is open for business , 27 million customers can be catered for .
it has a list of 20,000 things that need to be put right - from fire extinguishers that do n't work to doors that wo n't open ... and now lights that wo n't switch off .
