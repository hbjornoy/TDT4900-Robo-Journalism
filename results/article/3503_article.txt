striker johnny adair , 16 , shattered his tibia in a horror tackle during a sunday league match two weeks ago .
he was taken to hospital for an x-ray , before being sent home to recover in a plaster cast .
however , the teen was shocked to wake up the next day to find councillor jason ward - who had refereed the match - had sent him a facebook message making fun of the horrific injury .
it read : ` sorry to hear of your `` broken '' leg , probably happened during the 15th roll , not the challenge !
` it 's only a crack , not a real break .
football is a physical game played by men .
` maybe think about netball or rounders in future .
get well soon .

today , johnny said he was ` disgusted ' to have received the sarcastic messages .
' i knew straight away it was a horrendous tackle but the ref was saying if i 'd really broken my leg i 'd be crying , ' said johnny , who lives with his mother amanda kemp , 38 , in southam .
` he even said he was going to book me for diving .
after i dragged myself off the pitch , the ref never came to check if i was ok or show any concern really .
` then he sent me these sarcastic messages on facebook making fun of me and saying i should play netball or rounders instead .
` it 's shocking .
a ref should n't behave like that .
