british fashion designer john galliano has been stripped of france 's highest civilian award -- because of his conviction for racism .
the 51-year-old was made a legion d'honneur three years ago by the then conservative president nicolas sarkozy .
but a year ago galliano was found guilty of making ` public insults based on origin , religious affiliation , race or ethnicity ' .
the british fashion designer john galliano , centre , pictured in paris in february 2011 , has kept a low profile since being accused of drunken antisemitic insults .
the conviction resulted in a fine equivalent to just under # 50,00 and related to a series of anti-semitic rants in his local paris bar .
now francois hollande , france 's new socialist president , has taken the almost unprecedented step of revoking the award .
the decision was published in a decree signed by the head of state and published in the country 's official journal .
galliano lost his job as artistic director of the dior fashion house over the comments , which he blamed on his addictions to drugs and alcohol .
during his paris trial , a criminal court heard how , in february 2010 , galliano spat poisonous words at museum curator geraldine bloch about being jewish .
the designer , picture in march 2005 has been stripped of his highest civilian award .
he also subjected a friend of ms bloch , who was of south asian origin , to racist abuse .
in a third incident , the court saw an amateur video of galliano declaring a love for adolf hitler and referring to jews being gassed in concentration camps .
galliano has kept a low profile since his conviction , with some reports suggesting he is considering a full-time move to los angeles .
the legion d'honneur is given to those who have served france , or the ideals of liberty , equality and fraternity which it upholds .
galliano became creative director at dior in 1996 , and won british fashion designer of the year four times .
