two new yorkers either do n't care about or do n't understand the city 's byzantine parking regulations .
despite owing almost $ 350,000 for over 2,200 parking tickets between them , the two individuals are n't even at the top of the list of worst scofflaws in new york .
that honor goes to a new jersey-based company that owes more than $ 316,000 for over 1,700 tickets , according to the city .
the 10 worst offenders were made public monday by the new york post .
parking tickets : some people pay them , others owe six-figures worth of fines .
wallinton , nj-based consolidated dairies owes a staggering $ 316,059 -- including over $ 37,000 in interest -- for 1,759 tickets racked up by drivers since 2005 , according to the post .
a message left for comment by mailonline with the dairy products distributor was not returned .
the top 10 list , first reported by the post , is made up almost entirely of companies - except for two people .
manhattan resident john caruso is indebted $ 176,821 for the 872 tickets he 's racked up in the past 8 years , including over $ 54,000 in interest , according to the post , which speculated the reason he ca n't be tracked down is because he 's never lived at the address listed for him in city records .
the greenwich street address the city has for him used to have mailboxes for non-residents , according to a doorman questioned by the post .
coming in just after caruso is brooklyn 's anthony grady , who owes $ 172,250 towards 1,404 tickets dating back to 2005 .
when the post attempted to reach grady , there was an eviction sign on the scofflaw 's door .
source : nyc department of finance .
former neighbors defended him , telling the post that the parking signs in the area are confusing because of a nearby school .
` the school has different schedules of when you can or ca n't park on the road .
the signs -lsb- are -rsb- a little bit hidden , ' kelsea baker told the paper .
