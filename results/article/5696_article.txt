company boss mike waterton , 43 , posted pictures of a luxury holiday just days after his firm was wound-up still owing workers their wages .
the boss of a company that went bust days before christmas was branded ` heartless ' yesterday after he allegedly took a luxury holiday while his ex-employees went unpaid .
mike waterton , 43 , put photos on his website appearing to show him in cancun , mexico , less than a week after his temping agency was wound up .
he claimed this morning that the photos were actually taken by a friend who was on holiday in mexico .
former staff say they were still owed hundreds of pounds after the business in tunbridge wells , kent , closed without warning on december 11 .
five days later , mr waterton , who is also an author and motivational speaker , posted pictures apparently showing him in a pool at the casamagna marriott resort -- his face obscured by his book 50 grades of pay : how to earn more money .
another photo showed two cocktails on a beachside table .
the hotel charges in cancun up to # 960 a night for its most luxurious rooms overlooking the sea .
mateusz matczak , 20 , a former employee of tempnetwork , told a local newspaper : ` i was owed # 470 .
my mum did n't get paid either -- we worked together and live together so we did n't have money for anything .
` we had to borrow money from friends ... the agency sent a message saying they were `` sorry for this situation and we will try to help you find another agency '' .
many of the workers are from poland and had to cancel trips home due to unpaid wages .
another worker , who did not want to be named , said : ` i was meant to be going to poland for christmas , but when tempnetwork closed down i was owed nearly # 800 .
` i had to cancel the holiday because i did n't have enough money to even get a taxi to the airport .
this man is in mexico while all his workers are owed their wages -- he is a heartless and friendless man who knows no shame .
