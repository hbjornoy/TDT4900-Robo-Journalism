a rare letter penned by firebrand civil rights protester malcolm x shortly after he converted to islam and changed his name is expected to fetch $ 20,000 when it goes under the hammer .
the six-page note , written in 1950 , is one of the earliest known examples of the black power campaigner using the malcolm x moniker for which he would later become famous .
in the letter , written from inside jail , he discusses his love for the boston music scene , and jazz in particular , while grappling with the demons of his ` sinful past ' .
historic : this letter , written in 1950 by malcolm x as he was in jail , discusses his love for jazz music , his ` fear ' about returning to that sinful life , and is one of the first times he signed using ` x ' instead of his last name .
the activist , who was born malcolm little , was sent to prison in 1946 for larceny and breaking and entering after a life of petty crime and trouble with the law .
but once in prison he discovered islam and joined the lost-found nation of islam , dropping his ` slave ' last name and adopting the letter ` x ' , symbolic of a stolen identity , in its place .
malcolm x worked in jazz clubs as a youth , but after being jailed he converted to islam , renounced his former life , and became a civil rights campaigner .
the letter , which will be auctioned later this month by rr auction in boston , is addressed from prison to an unknown member of the islamic nation movement .
in it , malcolm discusses his love of jazz music , calling the musicians ` wielders of souls ' , and praising its ` comforting effects ' .
however , he also admits that he fears ` the temptations of that life and its memories ' , adding : ' i steer as far clear from the subject as possible unless i know the fellows are brothers -lsb- muslims -rsb- .
' in the note he asks his fellow believer to send him a list of all the jazz musicians he knows that follow islam so he can also write to them from his cell .
