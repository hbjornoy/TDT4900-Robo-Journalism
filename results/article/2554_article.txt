poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three-minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value .
it 's quite a venture - and must have been a huge investment .
there are 21 rooms , all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds .
i keep thinking about phil neville , the former england footballer whose home once appeared in hello !
and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling .
which is to say that poets house is glossy and lavish , but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch , not least because the finish is so good .
there is n't a scuff in sight .
state of the art : poets house is as much a sex and the city retreat as a hideaway in genteel ely .
no , it might not be to all tastes -lrb- there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them , such as lines from kipling : ` since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house , friend comforting friend ' -rrb- and the floors are given over to black-and-white squares with embedded stars .
but you would be hard pressed not to have a good time here .
we arrive on a wet blustery evening .
i pop into reception and ask where we can park and am told to leave the car exactly where it is .
valet parking will sort it at no extra charge .
then a man who says he has a hungarian father and german mother escorts us purposefully to our room , opens the door and says : ` you have every shade of grey in here .
' he must have used the line dozens of times , but still gets a kick from it .
we unpack our whips -lrb- sorry , wash bags -rrb- before hurrying down to the shiny , funky bar and order two glasses of bubbly .
black and white : poets house incorporates smart , clean lines , elegant d√©cor and crisp white tablecloths .
we 're in the zone , sitting on stools at the flashy bar as if auditioning as extras for a sex and the city sequel , and have to pinch ourselves that this is ely
