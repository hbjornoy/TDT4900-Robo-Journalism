most dog adoption ads play up the pet 's charm and eager personality , but the humane society has taken a different approach .
the organization 's silicon valley shelter , in milpitas , california , is brutally honest in a blog post warning readers not to adopt ` eddie the terrible ' , a two-year-old chihuahua .
the tongue-in-cheek attack on eddie 's character claims : ` inside that innocuous , adorable blonde package exists tons - indeed , whole square miles - of naughty .
' naughty : the humane society silicon valley is brutally honest in an adoption posting for ` eddie the terrible ' , a two-year-old chihuahua .

honestly he 's a little whiffy with some adults , too .
not in an eat-them sort of way but in `` this makes me very nervous '' sort of way .

happy ending : eddie , pictured here with a humane society staff member , has been adopted by a big-hearted couple .
