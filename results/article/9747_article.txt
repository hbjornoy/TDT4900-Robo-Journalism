arsenal forward lukas podolski has provided the clearest indication yet that he is open to quitting the club in january .
the germany international has hardly featured for the gunners this season and has grown increasingly frustrated at his lack of action .
he looked set for a move away in the summer , but olivier giroud 's ankle injury scuppered any possibility of him leaving .
lukas podolski has found first team opportunities difficult to come by at arsenal this season .
podolski was all smiles on monday when awarded the silbernes lorbeerblatt by chancellor angela merkel .
but the forward had admitted he is finding his lack of minutes difficult to take and could leave the emirates in january .
` of course i am not happy with my situation right now , ' admitted the german .
' i ca n't be satisfied with that .
we 'll see what happens in january .
the signings of alexis sanchez and danny welbeck had pushed podolski further down the pecking order .
` it is hard when you ca n't do what you love .
i do n't know why that is , you 'd have to ask my coach -lrb- arsene wenger -rrb- in england .
` if you ca n't play then you ca n't say he 's not playing well or he has a crisis if you 're not given the chance .
` if you only come in for 8 or 10 minutes it is hard to get into the game .
