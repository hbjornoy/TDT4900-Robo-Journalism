justin rose will try to forget that he is on home soil as he looks to make the open championship his third victory in succession this week .
rose produced a flawless closing 65 to win the scottish open at royal aberdeen on sunday , a fortnight after winning the quicken loans national on the pga tour .

i played beautiful golf that week , good enough to win and i know that .
there 's been a few occasions where i 've had good runs and a few occasions where i 've been on the bad side of the draw .
` if you go out and play wonderful golf you can make
