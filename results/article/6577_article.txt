return : sigurdsson is back in wales after a two-year spell in at spurs and monk says he returns a better player .
he said : ` he is a quality player who has come back a better player than when he left , .
` he had a difficult time at tottenham and probably did n't play as regularly as he would have wanted , but obviously there was a lot of competition for the places in the team he was vying for .
' i spoke to him about it .
i felt that every time he did play he felt because his chances were limited he had to prove something or score a goal .
