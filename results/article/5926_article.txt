president barack obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in american society as racism and bias .
obama told bet ` what i told the young people who i met with , that we 're gon na have more conversations like this over the coming months , is this is n't gon na be solved overnight .
this is something that is deeply rooted in our society .
it 's deeply rooted in our history .
` but the two things that are going to allow us to solve it .
number one : is the understanding that we have made progress .
and so , it 's important to recognize , as painful as these incidents are , we ca n't equate what is happening now to what was happening 50 years ago .
and if you talk to your parents , grandparents , uncles , they 'll tell you that things are better .
not good , in some cases , but better .
' he continued , ` and the reason it 's important for us to understand progress has been made is that then gives us hope that we can make even more progress .
the second thing that i insisted to these young people is , we have to be persistent .
because , typically progress is in steps .
it 's in increments .
` you know , when you 're dealing with something as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society , you got ta have vigilance , but you have to recognize that it 's going to take some time
