britain has spent more than # 100 million in the past year on consultants to combat cyber espionage and the growing use of the internet by terrorists .
now , mps are investigating the soaring costs of employing private contractors , some paid the equivalent of # 150,000 a year , three times the average wage at gchq , the government 's signal and intelligence agency .
the specialists are mostly it experts recruited to ensure the security agencies have state-of-the-art systems to run complex surveillance operations , thwart cyber attacks and provide digital back-up .
soaring costs : mps on the intelligence and security committee are have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by mi5 , mi6 -lrb- pictured -rrb- and gchq .
but mps on the intelligence and security committee are so concerned about the size of the consultancy fees , they have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by mi5 , mi6 and gchq .
last year , mi5 spent # 56.8 million on consultants , 73 per cent up on the previous year .
this year , the bill is predicted to rise by 52 per cent to more than # 80 million .
and gchq last year spent # 43 million on 297 part-time contractors at its cheltenham headquarters .
under last year 's spending review , all three agencies are facing an 11 per cent cut .
but the cutbacks have left gaps which are being plugged by outside contractors .
the huge fees paid are understood to have angered serving staff , some of whom are on salaries of less than # 25,000 .
earlier this year , gchq directors complained they could n't keep staff because of poaching by google and microsoft which could afford to offer generous pay deals .
whitehall sources argue that private consultant costs are high because of ` public sector pay constraints ' .
a gchq spokesman said : ` gchq takes controlling the cost of consultants very seriously .
