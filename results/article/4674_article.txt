the classic restored ferrari has been transformed back to original owner steve mcqueen 's personal spec - thanks to its le mans-winning owner .
mcqueen was the first owner of the 1967 ferrari 275 gtb/4 after he took delivery while on the set of bullitt .
he had the original silver car re-sprayed to red and fitted the wheels from his ferrari nart spyder , which he had previously crashed .
but a later owner decided to spend $ 10,000 controversially having it transformed from a coupe -lrb- berlinetta -rrb- into a convertible -lrb- spyder -rrb- .
the result was a stunning conversion - but the ferrari had lost the mcqueen factor .
it was later resprayed yellow and then silver before it was bought in 2011 by australian racing star vern schuppan .
mr schuppan , a mcqueen fan who won le mans in 1983 , decided to ` bite the bullitt ' and have the car returned to the identical condition as when his hollywood hero owned it .
he handed the car over to ferrari and its classiche department which certifies , restores and repairs special cars from the italian marque .
