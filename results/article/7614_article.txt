a utah man known to be a white supremacist will go to jail for kidnapping , tying up and tattooing a woman against her will , authorities announced .
robert calder , 40 , was sentenced monday to one year behind bars after pleading guilty to felony kidnapping .
an aggravated assault charge against him was dismissed , records showed .
the judge suspended a one to 15-year term and instead gave calder credit for 162 days served and also ordered him to serve out a 36-month probation , the salt lake tribune reported .
where it happened : the suburban salt lake city apartment complex where calder held , tattooed and beat the woman against her will .
calder , who goes by the name ` stinger , ' found himself in police custody after he and six members of the silent aryan warriors gang met a woman he soon accused of being an undercover fbi agent , according to an affidavit cited by the paper .
he pointed a gun at her face before tying her ankles and wrists and gagging her with a sock , according to police .
the sock was held in place with duct tape wrapped around the woman 's head .
stinger is then believed by police to have told the woman he would ` finish her tattoos ' before using an ink gun to write ` ratta 100 % ' on her stomach .
calder then repeatedly beat her until she passed out , police said .
stinger was the only gang member she could identify out of the seven that were in her apartment that afternoon .
he would not snitch on the others .
