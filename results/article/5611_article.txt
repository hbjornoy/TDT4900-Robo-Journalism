atletico madrid striker fernando torres has suggested luis suarez is struggling to score goals for barcelona because he is not the main man at the club .
the uruguay international persuaded the catalan giants to part with # 70million to secure his services last summer after scoring 31 premier league goals for liverpool in 2013-14 .
but the 28-year-old has failed to replicate his goalscoring exploits for his new club and former liverpool striker torres believes it is because he is playing second fiddle to lionel messi .
luis suarez joined barcelona in the summer from liverpool for # 70million .
suarez scored 31 premier league goals for liverpool last season as he won pfa player of the year .
suarez has struggled to recapture that form since his big-money move to the catalan giants .
fernando torres says suarez is less prolific for barcelona than at liverpool because he is not the main man .
` you have to realise that luis comes from making 50 goals in a team in which he was the one who made the goals , ' torres told as .
` at barca you have to start to subtract that amount because messi makes 50 a year .
that is normal .
' suarez has scored just two la liga goals this season and five in all competitions but torres still believes the striker is fundamental to barcelona .
` he is fundamental .
he is a very good player .
against us in the match in the calder√≥n , the damage that was done to us was done by him .
