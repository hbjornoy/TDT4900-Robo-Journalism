` you 're getting sacked in the morning , ' sang the villa fans after emmanuel adebayor had scored tottenham 's third goal from the penalty spot .
` that 's a bit harsh , ' quipped spurs boss tim sherwood .
` we 're 3-0 up .
' the chant was aimed at villa manager paul lambert , but it could have applied to either of the men standing in the dug outs at white hart lane .
sherwood is certainly on borrowed time , with tottenham chairman daniel levy neglecting to mention his manager by name - let alone thank him - in his end-of-season address .
the 45-year-old was seemingly intent on enjoying his final game in charge , celebrating paulinho 's opening goal with self-conscious aplomb and then giving fan danny grimsdale his gilet and inviting him to sit on the bench in the 84th minute .
happy ending : tottenham booked a place in europe next season with a comfy win against aston villa .
comfortable : tim sherwood 's future as tottenham boss is in doubt but he finished the season in style .
close to the edge : after seeing his side well beaten again , villa boss paul lambert could also be axed .
