a stretch of wales ' highest mountain mount snowdon has been put on the market for # 7million after a sheep farmer decided to sell up .
dafydd morris from caernarfon , gwynedd , has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600-acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain .
the 76-year-old , who still farms the land , bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill-farming .
clogwyn du ' r arddu -lrb- pictured -rrb- is part of the area for sale and is known as one of the top spots for rock climbing .
he told mailonline : ` the reason we are selling is because it has become very difficult to farm , especially in the past two years .
` people were saying they were worried about the environment and they were n't happy about the way the land was being farmed .
` so i was thinking of giving them the chance by allowing them to buy the acres .
' mr morris said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600-acres .
` it will go to someone who wants to look after the environment .
` people can come there with their children and bring their tents .
schools will be able to come up and see a different area of the mountain .
' mr morris , 76 , said he is selling as the area has become difficult to farm , particularly in the last two years .
the area for sale includes one of britain 's top rock climbing spots , clogwyn du ' r arddu , and a 112-acre space called cwm arddu , which is on the market for # 2.5 million .
remaining land will be sold off acre-by-acre at a cost of # 12,000 .
but mr morris , the former chairman of the independent council of the welsh highland shepherds , says he does n't mind if there are no takers , as he will carry on as he had done .
` we just want to give those people that want to take care of the environment the chance
