friends say pippa middleton has decided against taking the full-time job in the u.s. .
it was billed as the dream job that would make pippa middleton a household name in america .
but more than four months after the headline-grabbing announcement that she was to join the nbc network as a special correspondent in a # 400,000 deal , she has yet to be seen on screen -- and friends say she has decided against taking up a full-time job in the united states .
the duchess of cambridge 's sister has shot a series of reports for the long-running today show in rural wyoming , but none has seen the light of day .
and it was only when the mail on sunday asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to pippa explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the us .
the source said : ` there were talks and pippa did a test shoot which went really well .
but for various reasons , a regular show with pippa is n't going to happen .
ultimately she did n't want to commit herself to a big job in the us .
she 's got a boyfriend in geneva and her family in the uk .
it was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind .
` she will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis .
` nbc were really pleased with the test shoot , but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent , which is what nbc wanted .
it was pippa 's decision not to go ahead .
it 's not where she sees her future .
' one nbc insider said : ` pippa -- or the lack of her -- has been the talk of the company .
everyone is wondering what has happened to her ?
` there was all that fanfare when she went off to wyoming , and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio .
but there 's been nothing but silence for months .
it 's clear that someone has had reservations -- but whether that 's from nbc 's side or her side
