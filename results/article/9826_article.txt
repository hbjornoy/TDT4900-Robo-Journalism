simone matthews felt a tummy tuck was the ` perfect way ' to mark her 50th birthday .
with her 50th birthday approaching , simone reeves decided that celebrating with a cruise or party was n't going to be enough .
neither was she interested in new clothes or a fancy meal .
instead the grandmother from kent treated herself to a new stomach .
the # 4,800 operation was , she says , the ultimate 50th birthday treat to herself .
simone , who has three grown-up children , is one of a growing number of women said to be marking their milestone birthdays with surgery .
and she says the decision to go under the knife just weeks before her 50th was one of the best she has ever made .
explaining her decision she said : ` a tummy tuck was something i had thought about but the time never seemed right .
` then i was facing a new decade , my circumstances had changed dramatically and it seemed not only the perfect time , but also the perfect way to mark the occasion .
` it was a lot of money to spend on a birthday treat but i felt i deserved it , and because i had divorced and downsized , for the first time in my life i had the money available .
` now thanks to my operation i have entered my fifties looking and feeling better than ever .
' entering her forties had been a very different experience for simone , who found she was increasingly conscious of what she calls her ` jelly belly .
' after giving birth to ben , now 34 , candice , 28 , and nicholas , 27 , by caesarean , she had always been unhappy with the scar .
then aged 41 she underwent a hysterectomy and the additional scarring meant her tummy ` never recovered .
' she explains : ` i was left with an apron of saggy skin that i absolutely hated .
i knew no amount of exercise would change it .
` i did my best to hide it in spanx underwear and always wore shorts over my bikini .
i just assumed that at my age it was too late to fix or worth worrying about .
' but that changed when in 2001 simone separated
