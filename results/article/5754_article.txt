a large parcel containing the four matching sets of school uniform arrived at the girls ' home two days ago - and they could not wait to try them on .
the four-year-old sisters , who in 2009 became the first double set of identical twins to be born in britain thanks to ivf , could n't wait to try on their outfits -- and now they are eagerly counting down to the start of term .
their mother lisa , 38 , from billingham in county durham , said : ` seeing them in uniforms makes them seem so grown up .
i know i will shed a tear when i wave them off on their first day .
' she added : ` some children might be nervous starting school .

she says : ` the girls went to the nursery attached to the school so they are known to many of the staff .
` but to help teachers who do n't know them , i plan to put hair ties with different coloured bobbles in the girls ' hair -- with blue for twins jessica and hannah and red for twins heidi and annabelle .
