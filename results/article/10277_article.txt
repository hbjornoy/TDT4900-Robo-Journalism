mrs raffle , 35 , who lives a mile from the site , said she ` should have invited him back for coffee ' at the ancient monument .
landmark : stonehenge had an unexpected guest tonight in the form of u.s. president barack obama .
dwarfed by history : the president was given privileged access to wander among the stones themselves .
mrs raffle , 35 , who was with her three sons , aged two , six and seven , told sky news : ` he waved at us first after my husband marched us all the way there on the chance we might get to see him .
` we kind of edged closer and closer until he noticed us and waved .
we waved back and then one of the high security men edged us forward and he was moving forward at the same time , which was very exciting .
` the first person to say something was actually james .
he said `` welcome to england '' .
' mr obama had ordered his marine one to make the unscheduled landing at boscombe down airbase in wiltshire after flying out of newport in south wales following the nato summit .
mrs raffle said : ` at that point , he shook his hand and then he shook all of our hands .
he said `` it is such a beautiful place , do you live around here ?
'' ` we said we have just moved to the area .
