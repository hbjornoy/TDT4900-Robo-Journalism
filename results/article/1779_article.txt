mo farah already has one eye on next year 's world championships and the other on the 2016 olympics as he looks to put his ` toughest year ' behind him .
a difficult 2014 has seen the olympic superstar disappoint on his london marathon debut before illness forced him out of the commonwealth games .
he bounced back with double gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at the recent european championships in zurich to set himself up for a brighter 2015 centred around the worlds in beijing .
back on home soil : mo farah poses on the track ahead of the sainsbury 's birmingham grand prix .
` it 's been an up and down year but i 'm back on top now , ' said farah .
` it 's been very difficult , from the london marathon , where i wanted to do better , to then getting ill and missing the commonwealth games .
it 's been a struggle but now i 'm back .
' i learned a lot from the marathon and i 'm not ready for that yet , but after rio we 'll try again but for now i 'll concentrate on the track .
` it 's been the toughest year of my career for sure , certainly the toughest i 've had for many years .
i had n't been injured for many years and this season was tough .

` i 'm already looking ahead to beijing but in long distance running you can only take one year at a time , you ca n't look two years beyond .
but yes , it 's obviously there .
' much was made of the double olympic champion missing the commonwealth games in glasgow this summer but he accepts the spotlight he is under .
` there 's always pressure and as an athlete you put more pressure on yourself , ' he said ahead of sunday 's sainsbury 's birmingham grand prix .
` there 's never going to be the level that there was at the london olympics so you just get on with it .
