fa chairman greg dyke could not have picked a more painfully appropriate title for his latest read -- a death in brazil .
the beleaguered boss was pictured engrossed in the book while england trained in belo horizonte ahead of tuesday 's dead-rubber against costa rica .
engrossed : fa chairman greg dyke was seen reading ' a death in brazil ' ahead of england 's training session .
england were training in belo horizonte ahead of the game against costa rica .
sir trevor brooking also seemed interested in dyke 's read .
but the title of dyke 's read could well tell the story of england 's disastrous world cup campaign .
hodgson 's humiliated squad will return to the uk on wednesday having been eliminated at the group stage for the first time since 1958 after defeats to italy and uruguay .
dyke , though , made the bizarre decision to guarantee hodgson 's future as boss on friday afternoon , just half an hour before costa rica 's bryan ruiz scored the goal which confirmed england 's early exit .
for the record , his book -- by peter robb - tells the story of brazil 's history and the distance between the rich and the poor which still exists in the country .
it is the distance between england and the top teams at this world cup , however , which should be his chief concern over the coming weeks .
