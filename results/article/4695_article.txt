most property listings feature the usual , number of bedrooms , number of bathrooms , the size of the garden .
but this one is a little different .
a woman in indonesia whose husband has passed away has decided to offer an extra little incentive for buyers interested in her house ... her hand in marriage .
wina lia , 40 , poses outside her house .
she is selling the property but has also offered herself up for a potential marriage with it .
single mother wina lia , 40 , is selling her house for around # 51,000 but she stipulates in her advert that , ` buyers who do n't negotiate the price can ask the owner to marry -lrb- terms and conditions apply -rrb- .
' and although it started as a small ad , the offer has now gone viral .
indeed , wina 's estate agent says that they have been inundated with calls .
dian purna dirgantara told time that the advert had been , ` quite successful .
' he said : ` since yesterday morning there are continuous calls , i do n't count how many , there must be dozens or even hundreds .
' and he clarified that should they choose , the new owner could buy the property without having to take wina along with it .
wina 's house - which she is selling for around # 51,000 - has two bedrooms , two bathrooms , a fish pond and a parking space .

' and i said o.k. to it .
