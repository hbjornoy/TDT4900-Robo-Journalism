a travelling freak show has been forced to advertise a vacancy for a ` wolf boy/girl ' in order to comply with britain 's employment laws .
the circus of horrors , which reached the finals of britain 's got talent in 2011 , had signed up jesus ` chuy ' aceves of mexico , who has a medical condition that means hair grows all over his face , to take part .
but the producers found their new appointment breaches a government law which requires the job to be advertised in the uk on websites so that british jobseekers can apply if they wish .
hair raising : mexican wolf boy , jesus aceves , had been signed up for the show before circus bosses were told they had to put the job out for any uk candidates .
if no british wolf boy or girl can be found , then jesus will get the job .
according to the online advert , the successful candidate will earn up to # 500 per week and that all applicants must be genuinely hairy -- people with beards or wearing masks are unacceptable .
the advert states applicants ` must have a minimum of 60,000 hairs growing on the face and linking up with the hairline , hair on the head is not included ' it adds : ` duties to include all aspects of working as a wolf person and any other circus skills would be an advantage .
' the circus of horrors is playing 57 dates across the country over the coming months .
dr haze , the show 's creator , said : ` it is a strange state of affairs , we are pretty sure there are not any wolf boys or girls in the uk , but we still have to advertise the job over here .
` the thing is , the applicant must be a genuine wolf person .
' the advert says applicants for the job must have at least 60,000 hairs on their face .
perplexed : circus of horrors boss dr haze said the show had been left in a ` strange situation ' after being told they had to offer the role to uk jobseekers .
the circus of horrors rose to fame after appearing in britain 's got talent in 2011 .
