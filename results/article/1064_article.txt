held : sgt. omar velez is accused of killing a panamanian woman with whom he had a romantic relationship .
a u.s. soldier has been detained on suspicion of killing a panamanian woman .
sgt. omar velez was being held at fort bragg in north carolina on monday in connection with the murder of a young woman whose body was found in central panama on june 23 .
velez had not yet been charged , but will likely be brought before a u.s. military court , u.s. southern command spokesman kimberly hanson said .
velez was in panama conducting training as part of a unit associated with the sale of military equipment when the killing occurred .
local media report that velez had been romantically involved with the woman and was discovered near her body with a shovel after an apparent crime of passion .
the body was found on a farm near a river embankment , close to where a firearms training session was being held , according to panamanian officials .
some panamanians are outraged that the soldier 's diplomatic immunity protects him from local prosecution .
at least one panamanian organization is calling for a local trial .
relations between panama and the united states have historically snared over issues of sovereignty , and the incident threatens to stir old resentments .
a current of anti-american feeling still runs through the country more than a decade after the u.s. turned over control of the panama canal , said paul sutter , who teaches history at the university of colorado at boulder .
a century of u.s. jurisdiction over the canal and its surrounding area struck many in the country as a vestige of colonial days , and the americans ' imperious behavior made the situation worse , sutter said .
the tensions led to riots in the 1960s .
the u.s. army has expressed its ` deepest regret ' over the woman 's death , and pledged to fully investigate the killing .
