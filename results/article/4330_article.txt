a plucky pig destined for the butcher 's knife made one final bid for freedom - bolting through the door and scrambling on to the slaughterhouse roof .
but the portly porker 's adventure was cut short when the roof tiles collapsed under its weight , leaving it wedged in a hole .
scramble : the daring pig tries to get out of the hole .

dashed hopes : the pig seems to know that its bid for freedom has failed as it lies down , defeated .
it was tied up and taken back to the slaughterhouse in fengzhou , in china 's fujian province - where later met its fate .
the trapped pig was tied up by two men and taken back down to the slaughterhouse in fengzhou , in china 's fujian province - where it met its fate the following day .
slaughterhouse owner zhou feng , 49 , had forgotten to lock the door on the staircase inside , giving the pig its way out .
he said that he thought it was the pig 's active life on a free range farm that had given it the strength to make the daring climb .
he said : ` farmers ' pigs are much more wild and always run around and cause trouble , but it is the first time that a pig climbed up on to the roof .
' i will only slaughter factory-farmed pigs in future , they are far more docile .
