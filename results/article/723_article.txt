carles gil 's proposed # 3.25 million move to aston villa has hit a late snag over agent fees .
paul lambert had hoped to unveil the attacking midfielder on tuesday afternoon but has been forced to postpone an announcement as the final details are ironed out .
the club are still confident a deal will be done but must wait until this unforeseen development is concluded before providing confirmation .
carles gil -lrb- right -rrb- is a graduate of valencia 's youth academy and has represented spain at under 21 level .
paul lambert -lrb- centre -rrb- has watched his aston villa side score just 11 goals in 21 premier league games .
a five-year contract has been agreed with the player , but agent fees represent the final hurdle .
villa have only scored 11 goals in 21 premier league games this season and were booed off in their 1-0 defeat to bottom club leicester on saturday .
lambert wants gil , 22 , who has represented spain at under-21 level , to provide villa with the cutting edge that has been so desperately lacking for his side in recent weeks .
should the deal go through , gil will be reunited with villa 's colombian defensive midfielder carlos sanchez with whom he played while on loan at elche last season .
villa 's defensive midfielder carlos sanchez played with gil during the 2013-14 season at elche in spain .
