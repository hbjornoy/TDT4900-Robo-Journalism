his home is a graveyard , his job , shoplifting and his skin , cracked and pitted with psoriasis - the result of sleeping rough and a raging addiction to heroin and crack .
shanki , a 30-something from india 's punjab region , is just one of the estimated 600,000 illegal immigrants currently thought to live in britain .
but as new fergal keane documentary , the hidden world of britain 's immigrants , reveals , the british dream all too often proves a nightmare .
bleak : keane inside shanki 's dilapidated squat before he is thrown out and forced to sleep rough .
along with shanki , others to appear in the film , which focuses on the london borough of ilford , include harish , another punjabi rough sleeper who has resorted to industrial quantities of alcohol to get through the day , and lucky , a persistent thief .
yet despite their appalling living conditions and inability to get a job , the men say they would prefer stay in the uk rather than lose face by returning home to their families empty handed .
' i am crazy for drugs .
i do not look after myself or my body , ' shanki reveals .
` but i do n't have the willpower -lsb- to stop -rsb- .
he adds : ' i .
am ashamed to go home and you know why ?
i have been here nine years and i .
have f *** ing zero .
' i do n't want to go to india like this , never , ever .
really , i need to stop the drugs .
i 'm finished man , i 'm finished .
finished , finished , finished .

problem : a quarter of london 's homeless are from eastern europe , including the romanians of marble arch .
but it is n't just migrants from india and pakistan who arrive to discover that the uk is a far less welcoming place than they anticipated .
eastern europeans now make up a quarter of london 's rough sleepers
