lynne turner , 50 , was jailed for nine months for stealing # 28,000 to pay back loans from wonga.com .
a parish council clerk was in jail today after she got into deep debt and took out high interest cash loans with controversial wonga.com .
mother-of-two lynne turner was in charge of the village 's finances so decided to help herself to the funds , moving # 1,000 at a time into her own bank , a judge heard .
as clerk to hughenden parish council in buckinghamshire , she had access to all the money in their bank and ` borrowed ' at least # 28,000 of taxpayer 's money to try to cope with her huge loan repayments .
a judge told her on friday that she had betrayed the trust placed in her by the council and the villagers and had to be sent to prison immediately .
judge ian pringle heard that turner had amassed # 90,000 worth of loan arrears , on top of her # 380,000 mortgage .
she had fallen into debt after building an extension on her home and had taken out numerous loans and credit cards , the hearing at oxford crown court was told .
the 50-year-old stole a total of # 28,200 between august 2010 and may 2011 from the council where she had worked for 16 years .
turner was convicted by a jury on 10 counts of fraud .
the jury took less than an hour to reach unanimous verdicts after a three-day trial last month .
prosecutor jermone silva told a hearing : ` the fraud comprised of some 31 transactions and involved two accounts , which belonged to the defendant and the account held by the parish .
` initially the transfers were of # 300 pounds for the first two or three months .
` those transactions then became transactions of # 1,000 and they amounted to - in just under a year - a total of # 28,200 .
' the fraud was uncovered when turner resigned in june 2011 and her replacement , charlotte watts , noticed that six separate sums of # 1,000 had been marked with ` correction .
