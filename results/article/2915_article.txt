qpr striker charlie austin and tottenham talisman harry kane are on the verge of a sensational call up for the england squad .
austin , who has scored five times for rangers this season , is being monitored by england head coach roy hodgson and his scouts .
the rangers forward , who scored against chelsea in the 2-1 defeat last weekend , narrowly missed out on a place in the squad for the game with slovenia -lrb- november 15 -rrb- and scotland -lrb- november 18 -rrb- .
tottenham striker harry kane is on the verge of an england call up after shining this season .
kane scored tottenham 's winner at aston villa at the weekend and has already scored 10 times this season .
hodgson said : ` i think charlie austin is doing very well at qpr an he 's a player we have our eyes on .
` harry kane , who again does n't necessarily get into the team as first name on the team sheet , is another one we have our eyes on .
charlie austin has scored five premier league goals for qpr this season despite their struggles .
` so , i 'd like to think there are others , rickie lambert 's not just there because there 's no alternative .
` i believe he 's done a good job for me in the past , for the team in the past , but he understands that i ca n't give him a lifetime guarantee that if he 's not playing enough football , not doing well then he wo n't just lose his place in the liverpool team , he 'll lose his place in the squad .
' liverpool striker rickie lambert -lrb- right -rrb- was included in the england squad despite limited club game-time .
