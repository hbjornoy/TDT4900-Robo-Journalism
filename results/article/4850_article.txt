on trial : anxiang du , 54 , murdered a family of four with ` ruthless efficiency ' , a court heard .
a businessman massacred a family of four in their home in revenge at losing a seven-year legal dispute , a court heard yesterday .
with ` ruthless efficiency ' , anxiang du repeatedly stabbed university lecturer jifeng ` jeff ' ding , 46 , and his wife helen , 47 , in their kitchen , before moving upstairs where daughters nancy , 18 , and alice , 12 , were cowering in a bedroom .
the dings had been former business partners with chinese compatriot du and his wife , but their relationship had soured , triggering a decade of legal action .
du had travelled to the # 350,000 property like ` a man on a mission ' , armed with a kitchen knife and out for revenge on a couple who had left him with court costs totalling # 88,000 , the jury heard .
the bloodbath unfolded on the day of the royal wedding between prince william and kate middleton in april 2011 .
the family were stabbed a total of 51 times .
a 999 call was made from alice 's mobile phone that afternoon .
prosecutor william harbage qc warned the jury they would have to listen to the ` distressing ' 20-second call , in which ` more than one female scream could be heard ' .
the court heard the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on du , 54 , the night before , preventing him from disposing of his assets .
mr harbage said du knew he ` faced ruin ' .
he added : ` he resorted to violence , to murder in order to avenge himself of the people who had caused him such grief .
he did so not just by killing them -- mr and mrs ding -- but also by murdering their wholly innocent daughters .
` mr du made a plan and carried it out with ruthless efficiency .
' deaths : du , 55 , is accused of killing manchester metropolitan university lecturer jifeng ` jeff ' ding -lrb-
