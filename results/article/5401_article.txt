carl froch doubts whether george groves will ever win a world title .
not only does froch expect to beat his challenger a second time in saturday 's super re-match at a sold out wembley stadium but he does not expect the younger groves to succeed him as world super-middleweight champion once he retires .
` george is not tough enough to succeed at the highest level , ' says froch .
` he 's not a 12-round championship fighter .
video scroll down to watch froch question whether goves has 12 rounds in him .
in no doubt : carl froch is confident he will win his rematch with george groves .
` that 's partly because he is not really a super-middleweight .
he 's a light-heavyweight who struggles to get down to 12 stone .
but it 's not only physical .
` genetically he 's fragile .
he 's not cut out for this sport at world level .
as an amateur you can become an olympic or aba champion without your heart being tested .
` he has the skills but not the strength of heart or mind for the top of the pro game .
' at 36 , froch is still looking ahead to a major fight in las vegas , perhaps against american andre ward who is the only opponent he has not beaten .
not up to it : froch says george groves is not a natural super-middleweight .
there is also the prospect of completing a trilogy of mega-bouts with the only other man to defeat him , danish warrior mikkel kessler , who has announced his comeback from retirement .
' i love boxing and i 'm very good at it .
' he says .
' i get an obscene amount of money for doing it .
so why should i stop .
? ' no love lost : froch and groves will do battle again in the ring in front of 80,000 fans .
getting the job done : froch have to dig deep to comeback and win the first fight against groves .
while he does not expect to still be fighting at 40 , froch suspects that groves , at 25 , missed his best chance of a title in their controversial first fight .
