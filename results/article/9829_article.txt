french trainer freddy head has favourably compared his 2,000 guineas hope ride like the wind to last year 's fifth-placed runner charm spirit , who landed three group one races in 2014 .
ride like the wind was one of 34 colts which remain in the first classic of the season run on saturday , may 2 .
ride like the wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term , posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the group three prix djebel by a head .
french trainer freddy head likens his 2,000 guineas hope ride like the wind to charm spirit .
both the runner-up that day , make believe , and the fifth home , sinfonietta , could reoppose in the guineas to make it a three-pronged french assault on the 2,000 guineas .
head said : ` ride like the wind will run in the 2,000 guineas .
he has done very well since his last race , his work has been good , and i think that he has improved a bit .
` he is on the same sort of level as charm spirit was at this time last year .
they are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if ride like the wind settles better than charm spirit did last year i think that he has a good chance .
head says ride like the wind is ` on the same sort of level ' as charm spirit was at this time last year .
` that is why i have given him two runs already this season , to get the freshness out of him before the guineas .
' i was very happy with his prix djebel victory .
he settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow .
` the undulations at newmarket wo n't be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment i think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes .
