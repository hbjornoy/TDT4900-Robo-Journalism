janice sage became the owner of a picturesque maine inn 22 years ago , after entering a writing contest .
now the 68-year-old innkeeper is ready to retire and plans to hand off the keys to the center lovell inn and restaurant to a new owner with a new contest .
ms sage announced the contest late last year , and expects to receive 7,500 entries from prospective new owners by the may 7 deadline .
on monday , the daily mail online spoke with ms sage about her decision to finally step away from the inn she 's toiled at and invested $ 500,000 into for renovations .
all this could be yours : the owner of the center lovell inn and restaurant in maine is holding a contest , with the winner getting to take over ownership of the historic inn built in 1805 .
` i 've been in the business 38 years so it 's time to retire , ' ms sage said , adding that she 's looking forward to doing nothing in her retirement after years of 17-hour workdays .
ms sage says she ca n't reveal the essay that won her the inn in 1993 , but she believes her 16 years running a restaurant in maryland helped .
` one of the judges told me they chose me because they saw that i could carry on the inn and make it a viable business , ' ms sage said .
while ms sage has the right to sell the business , as the outright owner , she has decided to give it away with a new essay contest out of goodwill .
' i just want to pass it on to somebody else who is looking for an inn , who possibly ca n't own it on their own outright and i think this is a good way to pay it forward , ' she said .
ms sage hopes to read all of the applications by may 17 , and says she 'll be impressed by grammatically correct entries that show a passion for work .
