set in the idyllic derbyshire dales , surrounded by countryside and views of the moor , a cockerel 's call may not seem too unexpected .
but for one bird , his early morning wake-up calls have led to an asbo .
the owners of william welsummer , or willy , the cockerel have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise , after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early .
willy the cockerel has been waking neighbours up for three months at 4am and has now been given an asbo .
caroline and philip sutcliffe with william wilsummer - the offending cockerel - at their derbyshire home .
the noisy cockerel lives on the farm belonging to philip and caroline sutcliffe in eyam along with the rest of the couple 's birds .
they say other neighbours have never raised any problems with the bird .
mr sutcliffe said : ` it 's all a bit ridiculous - a bird having an asbo-type order .
we 've done everything we can and so far we 've managed to reduce the noise , but not put a stop to it .
` our neighbours have been living with the crows for three years since we moved here - and we consulted with them at the time to check it was okay .
' the couple said they keep birds as a hobby .
the asbo was given after simon bee , 51 , complained to derbyshire dales district council .
willy lives in the derbyshire dales in the village of eyam , which is popular with walkers and visitors to the dales .
mr and mrs sutcliffe have been given the winter to try and soundproof willie 's pen to stop noise complaints .
willy has been the subject of complaints by simon bee because of his regular 4am calls at the farm in eyam .
he said : ` this is not a farming community anymore .
it 's mainly tourism now and most of the people who live here are either retired or commuters .
` and the fact that mr sutcliffe has a field at the bottom of his garden does not make it a farm .
i would not have moved in next to a farm , but this is a residential area
