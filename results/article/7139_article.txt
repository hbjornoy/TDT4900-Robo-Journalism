david cameron said he had paid cash for work but not so the trader could avoid tax .
david cameron today waded into the row over cash-in-hand work - insisting it was okay not to ask for a receipt because the ` onus ' was not on tragers to pay their tax .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister said he had occasionally paid for goods and services in cash without getting a receipt , but insists that he has never helped someone ` evade the taxes that they should pay ' .
she added : ` if you have one-off payments for something , you may well pay cash .
the onus is on the trader , who is responsible for making sure they pay the taxes that they owe .
' mr cameron 's intervention came after labour 's shadow business secretary chuka umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a ` matter of good housekeeping ' and was a ` good thing to do ' .
mr umunna 's remarks were in response to the controversy sparked by labour 's shadow chancellor ed balls who said families had a duty document how much they pay every time they get their hedge trimmed .
mr balls said people had a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash jobs carried out by gardeners , cleaners and handymen .
but mr umunna this morning defended the shadow chancellor .
he said : ` is he demanding that your viewers keep every single receipt they get ?
... no , he was n't .
' however , he added : ` as a matter of good housekeeping it 's a good thing to do ' the tories this morning claimed mr balls 's suggestion revealed a ` complete lack of understanding ' about business .
work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said it was ` absurd ' .
he said : ' i do n't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process ; in other words , if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business , then of course i suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record , that 's the right thing to do .
