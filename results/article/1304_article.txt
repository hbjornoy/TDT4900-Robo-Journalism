before and after : lee charie , 32 , had to have part of his skull removed after falling 22 feet from a balcony in thailand two years ago .

when he was well enough to be transferred back to britain two weeks later , he was handed the missing chunk of his head in a box and carried it in his luggage .
now the swimming pool maintenance worker 's head has been fixed - with a plate made from metal normally found in the fuselage of space shuttles and passenger jets .
mr charie said : ` there 's a big slab of titanium in my head now and i 've got the nickname ` space shuttle head ' from my mates .
` the first thing i thought when i got it was that when i go through metal detectors at the airport it 's going to go off .
