jack wilshere is at the centre of another smoking controversy after a picture emerged of the arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub .
the england star , 23 , is recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by manchester united in november and is expected to make a first-team return by the end of the month .
this picture of wilshere posing with friends and holding the pipe , reportedly taken at a london nightclub last week , was uploaded to instagram on tuesday before being removed , but then subsequently reposted on twitter , leading to criticism from fans on the social media network .
jack wilshere -lrb- right -rrb- appeared to be holding a shisha pipe during a night out in london .
the same picture still remains on instagram , but wilshere is only just visible in the top right corner .
the diminutive midfielder was back in light training for arsenal last week .
shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco , usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar , through a bowl and hose or tube .
it is the third time wilshere has been caught up in a furore involving smoking .
he was pictured holding a cigarette outside a london nightclub in 2013 and again at a pool party in las vegas last summer after the world cup finals in brazil .
after that incident wilshere admitted he regretted his actions , saying : ` i have been seen before doing it .
i said then i made a mistake and i have made a mistake again .
i am young and i will learn from it .
' wilshere suffered ankle ligament damage during manchester united 's 2-1 win against arsenal in november .
the 23-year-old has had to face another lengthy spell on the sidelines after his latest setback .
