but gutsy miss khasal was determined not to let the thief get away and chased him into a nearby cul-de-sac .
` gut reaction ' : nawal khasa uses a plank of wood to re-enact the moment she hit burglar derek perry .

afterwards , perry tried to claim miss .
khasal should be arrested for assaulting him .
but officers disagreed and .
no action was taken against her .
