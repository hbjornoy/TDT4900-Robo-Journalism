air travellers today lampooned ryanair 's plans to offer # 10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand , pay to use the toilet or even parachute into america because it is so cheap .
the budget airline has announced it plans to fly to new york , boston , chicago and miami from london stansted , dublin and berlin from 2020 .
the # 10-a-ticket proposal is part of a wider plan to change its image and ` stop p ****** people off ' because boss michael o'leary 's schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers left many irate .
breaking new ground : ryanair 's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline offering flights from as little as # 10 but there has also been considerable fun at their expense .
but despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion , others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline 's expense .
some said that ryanair 's new york hub could be in nova scotia , canada , or passengers may have to ` sky dive in and hope you do n't land in the hudson river ' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs .
others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets , and if the # 10 deal would include any food , leg room , entertainment or any luggage .
jason bournemouth tweeted : ` it 's ryanair so new york means , at best , landing in new jersey .
probably iowa ' .
mail columnist andrew pierce wrote : ` ryanair to launch # 10 flight to us .
plus # 200 for luggage , # 200 for seat , # 1 to use loo ' .
sandie blicken replied : ` they do n't actually land anywhere you just do a sky dive and hope you do n't land in the hudson ' .
the budget airline 's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at europe 's largest low-cost carrier over the next five years .
the airline has set out proposals for one-way tickets costing from under # 10 , although some fares would be much higher .
ryanair says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen
