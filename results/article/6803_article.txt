i began collecting panini world cup stickers with my five-year-old son archie several weeks ago .
this was my attempt to indoctrinate him into the football world and to initiate his journey as a lover of the game - a journey which we all know will be full of ecstatic highs and lows of anguish .
what better place to begin the wee lad 's journey than in brazil ?
home : brazil will provide a brilliant backdrop to the world cup , but do n't expect them to win the tournament .
to an extent , my mission has succeeded .
he is aware that the world cup is coming and that there are many teams taking part , but he still ca n't get his head round why scotland are not going to be there !
many more of us feel the same .
i have enjoyed the process of opening the little packets to reveal the next exciting group of players who will be there in brazil to thrill us with their skills .
for the amount of money i have now invested i could have sent him there to see the final live !
one regret from my playing days is that i never played in a world cup .
perhaps i will have the opportunity as a scotland coach to go to one .
as we left the pitch at craven cottage last week , gordon commented on the performance of the tartan army that night .
` imagine going to a world cup with that lot , ' he said .
i dare to imagine !
support : the brazil national team will be under pressure to perform on home soil .
as the opening match approaches the excitement is growing .
who 's in each squad ?
who 's left out ?
who 's injured ?
who will be the stars ?
which team will be the surprise package ?
ultimately , who will win this magnificent football fiesta ?
many pundits have the host nation as the team to beat .
i 'm afraid i 'm going to be a party pooper and disagree .
i believe that , having won group a , they will exit at the first knockout stage , where they will lose to the team who finishes second in group b -
