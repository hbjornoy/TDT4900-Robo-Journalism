however , ms mcilveen argued that hugo is not dangerous .
` he 's playful , his tail would have been wagging ... but obviously hugo is a big dog , ' she said .
she has started a petition to save her family 's shar pei and it has already received over 700 signatures .
` this is important because hugo is innocent ... .
he is a friendly dog who has been treated unjustly because we have neglected to see that our inability to be vigilant has led to our boy being detained and threatened with death .
` he is our family member ... we love him , he means everything to us .
please do n't do this to hugo .
' ` we love him ' : hugo 's owners have claimed he is a friendly family dog who does n't deserve to die .
` obviously he 's a big dog ' : ms mcilveen has argued hugo is ` playful , his tail would have been wagging ' when he approached people off his lead .

she has begged for him to be brought home and has promised she will not let him off his lead again
