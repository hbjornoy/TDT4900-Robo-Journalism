` the premier league is the biggest league in the world .
i was watching a lot of tottenham during my time in portugal .
` the reason i moved to portugal was nothing to do with football - it was because of my family .
` we moved there when i was six , i got picked up by sporting when i was eight and i went through their youth system , all the way to the first team .
` it is kind of a strange background and everyone seems surprised by it .
but it just happened that way really .
` at the beginning it was hard because i did n't really speak the language .
i was seen as a bit of an outsider .
` but after i picked up the language when i was 12 or 13 , it was really easy .
