halloween is firmly on the horizon so weird , scary and creepy sights are becoming commonplace .
in this video , a dog attempts to get into the halloween spirit by transforming himself into the most intimidating predator of them all ... but falls somewhat short of giving anybody a scare .
the adorable pug wanders around the front driveway of his home nonchalantly dressed in a tyrannosaurus rex costume .
rawr !
an adorable pug gets into the halloween spirit in a dinosaur costume .
rest : after walking around for 30 seconds in the awkward costume the pug takes a breather .
the dog 's owner films the pet as he attempts to move about in the comical costume , which occasionally slips off as he awkwardly meanders about .
the t-rex costume also has two protruding claws which makes it look like the dog is ready to attack at any opportunity .
however , this cute canine is anything but frightening .
awkward : the pug 's movement is a little restricted and he peers out from within the comical costume .
' i think i need a smaller size ' : towards the end of the footage the costume slips off the pug .
