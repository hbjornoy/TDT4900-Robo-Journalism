pakistan 's former president pervez musharraf was today charged with murder over the assassination of benazir bhutto in 2007 .
the move completes the downfall of the man who once dominated his country but was driven out of office and exiled in disgrace .
the decision by a court in rawalpindi marks the first time any former army chief has been charged with a crime in pakistan .
charge : pervez musharraf , left , is accused of murder over the death of benazir bhutto , right , at a rally in 2007 .
musharraf has been charged with murder , conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation for murder .
the former army commando who took power in a coup in 1999 appeared in person at the hearing and pleaded not guilty to all charges .
the next hearing will take place on august 27 , when the first evidence will be presented .
ms bhutto was killed in december 2007 during a gun and bomb attack at a political rally in rawalpindi .
prosecutors claim that musharraf , who was then president , failed to protect her properly .
trial : musharraf is pictured being driven away from today 's hearing in rawalpindi under tight security .
musharraf , 70 , left pakistan in 2008 after being forced to resign from office , but returned to the country in march and vowed to contest this year 's elections .
however , the former leader enjoys little popular support , and has been faced with a host of legal problems dating back to his time in power .
he has been confined to his house on the outskirts of islamabad , and was brought to court today surrounded by tight security .
in addition to the bhutto case , musharraf is involved in a case related to the detention of judges and the death of a separatist leader .
he also faces threats from the pakistani taliban , which tried to assassinate him twice while he was in office and vowed to try again if he returned .
