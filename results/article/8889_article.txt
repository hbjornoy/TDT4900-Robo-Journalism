fa chairman greg dyke 's wide-ranging proposals to improve the future of the england team include going back in time to the days of a regionalised third tier of english football .
dyke , who goes public with the findings of his england commission at wembley today , discussed his plan with football league top brass at a dinner last night , having received fa board backing earlier in the day .
the central plank and most controversial of dyke 's commission recommendations is a new fourth tier of the english game featuring mainly b teams from the premier league plus possible conference club involvement as well as promotion and relegation .
back to the future : greg dyke 's latest plans are to regionalise lower leagues and introduce premier league b teams .
dyke wants a full debate on the merits of the cash-strapped league one and league two returning to the old third division north and south system which ran from 1921 to 1958 .
feedder clubs : southampton would prefer to build an official alliance with a lower league side .
the b team proposal has received strong support from the clubs -- if not the pl administrators -- with manchester city , manchester united and tottenham all very enthusiastic .
but dyke will suggest an alternative for pl clubs who oppose a b-team league , by offering them an official alliance with a lower-tier side .
southampton favour this feeder option , although football league fans might not be so enamoured .
both the football league and conference have board meetings today at which dyke 's recommendations will be at the top of the agenda .
