staring eagerly into the camera , this little toad is full of curiosity as he bobs his eyes above the water and surveys the scene , ready for his close-up .
the photographs were captured by french marine biologist mathieu foulquie , 39 , after he spotted the friendly toad in the resurgence of a little river near montpellier , france .
mr foulquie was investigating underwater in a river named ` la bueges ' when he put his hand on the river bed and the toad grabbed his fingers .
he says : ` he kept grabbing my hand as i was moving it , and then he became so friendly that he even started following me .
` the little guy just carried on coming towards me , even trying to climb up and hang on me !
i assumed this maybe was to have a bit of a rest from swimming .
