this image show attendees at a conference in saudi arabia on the topic ` women in society ' -- and not a single one is female .
the conference , reportedly held at the university of qassim last year , was attended by representatives from 15 nations , apparently all men .
the seats in the hall are filled with men in traditional arab dress apart from one wearing a blue chequered shirt .
no girls allowed : a ` women in society ' conference in saudi arabia which judging by this picture had an all-male attendance .
the photograph was published in a saudi newspaper last year , and has since been making the rounds on social networks .
twitter users have branded the image ` absurd ' , ` the height of misogyny ' and ` astonishing ' as the internet responded to what is only the latest proof of the gender gap in the middle-eastern nation .
segregation between men and women in the oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative wahhabi sharia law .
restrictions mean they are not allowed to drive , they must use separate entrances at banks and offices , and a plan to build a city for female workers only has been announced .
restricted : although they are now allowed to ride bikes and motorcycles , women in saudi arabia are still very much controlled by their fathers , brothers and husbands .
they also need permission from a male relative or their husband to work , travel , study or marry and a woman 's testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law .
small steps towards gender equality has been made in the past year .
earlier this year , king abdullah appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150-member shura council , an unelected body which advises the government .
in april , saudi arabia lifted the ban preventing women from riding motorbikes and bicycles , but only if they are accompanied by a male relative and dressed in full veil .
