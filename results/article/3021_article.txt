mystery : sylvain mollier , 45 , was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin a year and four months ago .
french police have ` all but closed ' an investigation into a mystery cyclist who was shot dead in the alps along with three members of a british-iraqi family , it emerged yesterday .
this is despite the first image of sylvain mollier being released -- exactly a year and four months after the atrocity .
the long delay has led to claims of a cover up being mounted around the 45-year-old 's past life .
he was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin , but the french led inquiry continues to focus on the al-hilli family , who lived in claygate , surrey , as the attackers ' main target .
an alleged ` vow of silence ' by those close to mollier has fuelled claims that an individual or group known to him wanted him dead .
mollier 's body was found in a forest layby near lake annecy in eastern france on september 5 , 2012 .
close by , in a bmw estate car , saad al-hilli , 50 , his wife ikbal , 47 , and her mother , suhaila al-allaf , 74 , lay dead .
each had been shot three times , all at least once in the head .
their two daughters , zeena , then 4 , and zainab , then 7 , survived .
the focus of the inquiry has so far been on a dispute that saad is believed to have had with his 54-year-old brother , zaid , over their father 's inheritance .
mollier was , however , involved in a dispute over a lucrative pharmacy business that was being transferred to his girlfriend , claire schutz , a 30-year-old heiress , by her parents .
mollier had just had a son with schutz and had given up his job as a metalworker at a factory making nuclear components .
there was tension over the amount of cash that mollier was accepting from schutz , including the money to buy the # 4,000 racing bike that he rode to his death .
