a hair stylist from new york is smartening up the city 's homeless by giving them haircuts on his day off .
mark bustos , 30 , usually works at a trendy salon in manhattan where he deals with glamour models and sexy photo shoots , but he has found a unique way to give back to the city .
every weekend , he wonders the city 's streets to find people who look as though they could do with a haircut and who might otherwise not be able to afford it .
mr bustons experience in hair-styling goes back to when he was a teenager .
at the age of 14 he was styling out of his parent 's garage .

client number one : this man was sitting on the corner of bowery and rivington street in manhattan when mark bustos found him .
a goat herder in jamaica : this man was trying to make a little extra money by charging tourists to come see his goats .
bustos is n't sure whether he was homeless , but he was definitely in need of a haircut .
mark bustos : his motto is simple : ` be awesome to somebody ' bustos , who kicked off his hairstyling career at age 14 out of his parents ' garage , said that he 's ` never made a penny in my life -lrb- that -rrb- has n't had to do with hair .
they do n't always know when their next haircut will be .
most times they ask me to buzz it all off ... til we meet again ... .
his haircuts for the homeless was inspired after taking a trip in may 2012 , to his native country of the philippines where he snipped away on underprivileged kids .
he said the trip gave him the idea and momentum to continue the good deeds back in the states .
` the feeling was so rewarding , i decided to bring the positive energy back to new york city .
' he has also done the same for poor people living in jamaica , costa rica and los angeles .
' i do believe people with a proper , professional haircut receive more respect than those who do not have a proper haircut , ' bustos
