alan pardew claims that matt phillips ' 40-yard wonder strike for qpr against crystal palace was better than david beckham 's goal from inside his own half at selhurst park 19 years ago .
phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over palace keeper julian speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards .
but it proved to be too little , too late as qpr went down to a 3-1 defeat on saturday afternoon .
palace manager pardew said : ` i remember beckham scoring the goal here and , from a technical point of view , phillips ' was better because it was an outstanding hit .
` matt can be very proud of it .
in 25 or 30 years on a training ground , i ca n't remember seeing a better goal .
' matt phillips unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner .
phillips ' effort dipped and swerved past julian speroni but it was too little too late for rangers .
phillips grabs the ball in a hurry as he makes his way back to the centre spot .
