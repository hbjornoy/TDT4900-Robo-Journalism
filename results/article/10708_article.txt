when cesc fabregas claims he is playing the best football of his life , it is worth pausing to place it in context .
this is fabregas , the star of an attractive arsenal side who passed and moved to the champions league final , a catalan who spent three years with lionel messi and co at barcelona and who conquered the world with spain in 2010 .
and , yet , in four months at chelsea he already seems like he was born to be jose mourinho 's tempo-setter in a team committed to entertain and hell-bent on winning .
cesc fabregas believes he is playing the best football of his career at chelsea right now .
the spaniard -lrb- left -rrb- passes the ball while being challenged by schalke 's kevin-prince boateng on tuesday .
` i feel in control and that 's what i like the most in football , ' said fabregas .
` i touch the ball all the time , i feel happy , i go and get the ball from here , from there , i can go forward , oscar drops deep .
i feel free , i feel confident .
` sometimes in the last three or four years in the national team and barcelona , i was playing like a no 9 .
i mean , i have to do it for the team and i enjoy it , and it 's all good .
but , here , where i am playing today , in these games , it 's where i enjoy my football the most .
i feel right now i am playing some of the best football of my career .
` i 've played in world cup finals , european championship finals , champions league finals with great teams .
i 'm not saying the -lrb- last two -rrb- games against west brom or schalke were the best , probably they were n't , but definitely they were games i enjoyed a lot .
' then the inner mourinho kicks in .
fabregas has a winning mentality , a touch of devilment , perhaps a selfish streak , which is sure to appeal to his latest manager .
fabregas once again starred in an emphatic chelsea win - they beat the german side 5-0 at the veltins arena .
