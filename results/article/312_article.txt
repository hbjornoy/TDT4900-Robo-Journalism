andy murray and amelie mauresmo have held talks with french coach loic courteau about him joining the former wimbledon champion 's team next year .
the 50-year-old well-respected frenchman is seen as having the credentials to add a wealth of experience to murray 's staff after the departures this year of eight-time grand slam winner ivan lendl and long-term coach and friend dani vallverdu .
andy murray and amelie mauresmo are looking at potential new additions to the coaching team .
loic courteau worked with mauresmo during her own career at the top of women 's tennis .
courteau is a former coach and still a confidant of mauresmo and helped guide the french two-time major winner to world no 1 in her own illustrious career .
courteau is currently coaching another frenchman , the world no 25 julien benneteau , and has nurtured him to an indian summer in his career .
but he is said to be open to the idea of teaming up with murray in 2015 .
murray started working with frenchwoman mauresmo ahead of wimbledon in june 2014 .
benneteau is 33 and , while courteau is committed to working with him at next month 's australian open , it is possible he could be persuaded to switch to team murray after that .
such a move would further entrench world no 6 murray 's relationship with coach mauresmo .
the 27-year-old scot 's support group is currently looking somewhat depleted after venezuelan vallverdu left to coach murray 's czech rival tomas berdych and his long-term fitness trainer and good friend jez green also departed for pastures new .
