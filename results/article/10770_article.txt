an amateur mixed martial arts fighter at a spokane event on friday attempted a spectacular maneuver : an off-the-cage roundhouse kick aimed right at his unwitting opponent 's face .
it failed spectacularly .
instead of landing his kick , the ill-fated go-getter wound up landing face first in the middle of the ring .
that left him wide open for his opponent to leap in and pummel him , which the opponent did .
the amateur brawler was likely attempting to replicate professional ufc fighter anthony pettis 's signature showtime kick .
pettis , a ufc championship titleholder , got his nickname showtime from the move .
it also helped him become the ufc lightweight champion , as well as a fan favorite .
as the deadspin writer who first pointed out the failed attempt says , it 's ' a spectacular reminder that we must dare to dream .
