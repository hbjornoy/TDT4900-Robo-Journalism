culinary casanova paul hollywood is spicing up the great british bake off once again , with fans pointing to simmering sexual tension between him and contestant ruby tandoh .
hollywood , 47 , made headlines in may when he split from his wife after developing a ` close friendship ' with 35-year-old marcela valladolid , his co-star on the american version of the tv baking competition .
and when he named ex-model miss tandoh star baker this week , viewers suggested it was not just her brioche he was sweet on .

the 21-year-old won the ` sweet dough ' challenge on tuesday night 's show , making a sweet tea loaf , hollywood 's recipe for apricot couronne and two varieties of european sweet buns .
but on twitter , many fans of the bbc2 series were more interested in romance than rolling pins .
katie roberts said : ` i 'm going to miss the great british bake off when it 's done .
' i enjoy living vicariously through the sexual tension between paul and ruby .
' mollie hinks joked : ` i thoroughly look forward to tuesday evenings and witnessing paul hollywood trying not to flirt with ruby .
' fans of the show have taken to twitter to say they are more interested in any signs of bubbling romance between the pair than any of the baked goods .
filming of the current , fourth series of the great british bake off began a few weeks after news of hollywood 's split from his wife alexandra emerged .
essex-born miss tandoh , who was briefly signed to leading agency models 1 , is now studying philosophy and history of art at university college london .
she struggled to impress hollywood 's fellow judge mary berry at first , but since winning her over is tipped to win .
this week miss berry called her bake ` almost perfect ' and her brioche ` delicious ' .
despite a less than promising start , student ruby is now tipped to win the competition .
