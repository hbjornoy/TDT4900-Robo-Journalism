australian scott hend edged angelo que in a play-off to clinch his maiden european tour title at the hong kong open .
a par on the first extra hole was enough to steer the 41-year-old past the filipino , who missed the green on the 18th and then over-hit his chip .
que 's fourth-round 66 forced the play-off after an intense back-nine battle , which ended with his birdie on the 18th tying things up with hend at 13 under par .
hend holds the trophy aloft after completing his first win on the european tour at the age of 41 .
the australian consoles angelo que after beating the filipino on an 18th hole play-off in honk kong .
but the 35-year-old will be left lamenting the fact that his three bogeys on the day - to hend 's two - and a costly second-round 69 ultimately cost him victory .
aged 41 , hend is the oldest first-time european tour title winner since cesar monasterio , who was 42 when he won the 2006 as st omer open .
he was understandably thrilled to secure victory , but he felt bad for que after his bogey sealed the play-off .
`` i felt quite calm , the only thing is that hole at the end you never want to have a go at the pin because you can make a bogey quite easily so i was n't really sure how to play it , '' hend told the european tour website .
herd became the oldest man to win his maiden tour title since cesar monasterio in 2006 .
que played well to force a play-off but will regret his three bogeys in a round of 66 that left him on 13 under .
`` unfortunately angelo made a bogey , i would have rather one of us made a birdie because he 's a great guy and it would be nice to earn the win on a positive note .
but i 'll take the win and i 'm ecstatic .
'' overnight leader marcus fraser 's double bogey on the opening hole blew the title race open and he struggled to get back in the mix with back-to-back bogeys on the 14th and 15th holes .
the 35-year-old also bogeyed the play-off hole , meaning herd 's par was enough to take the title .
