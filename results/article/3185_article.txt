a bar in new york has been forced to remove a sign reading ` no irish drunks ' after complaints from customers .
the dock bar & grill in montauk on long island had a sign displayed in the window with a banned list which included ` irish drunks ' along with strollers and cell phones .
after complaints were made , the owner george watson , pasted over a replacement sign which read ` no sensitive drunks ' .
a sign in the window at the dock bar in montauk , new york read ` no irish drunks ' along with no yapping mutts and no screaming kids .
after the uproar , the dock covered up the word irish so the sign would read ` no sensitive drunks ' this weekend .
mr watson told irish central : ` if you spoke about any other religion or race they would probably take offense to it ; the irish have a sense of humor .
' there were mixed reviews on the bar 's facebook page over the offending sign .

lol !!!!!!!!!!!! ' helen milne added : ` oooooh talk about limiting your clientele :-lrb- ' however another , helen cangemi , wrote : ` people , get a grip !
if you must be politically correct , please stay in the hamptons .
' maura donahue also quipped : ' i am beginning to think all this outrage is just an elaborate joke that i am gullible enough to fall for .
now that would be the irish i know and love !
' the dock is situated in montauk , a busy fishing town which is popular with tourists .
the owner george watson , a former new york city firefighter , bought the bar in 1973 .
he makes little apology for the bar 's attitude - where anyone can be the butt of the joke .
on his website he wrote : ` at the dock , we feel that in order for a joke to be funny , it must be told at someone 's expense .
we tell ethnic , sexist , and racial jokes - everyone gets their turn in the barrel .
