the team bought coloured lights from home depot and strapped them to a dji phantom quadcopter .
they then set up a camera with a long exposure on a tripod .
once the shutter was released , the drone flew around , and its light trail was captured .

' i then brought them back into the computer and created some cool patterns in photoshop .
' the team say the images took just a few hours to complete .
