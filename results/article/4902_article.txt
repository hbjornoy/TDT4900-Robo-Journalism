former president george w. bush said in a rare tv interview broadcast sunday morning that he was shocked to learn iraqi dictator saddam hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive u.s. invasion .
` you know , when he was captured , i was told that the fbi agent that talked to him -- he said , `` i just did n't believe bush '' , ' he told cbs newsman bob schieffer sunday morning .
` and it 's hard for me to believe he did n't believe me .
' ` we 'd given an ultimatum to the taliban and delivered , ' bush said .
' i make the point in the book , of course , that -- and dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president , you better mean it .
' that line is already being interpreted on twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at president barack obama , whose ` red line ' ultimatums leveled at syria and iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless .
former president george w. bush appeared sunday for a rare tv interview with cbs newsman bob schieffer on ` face the nation ' ' i just did n't believe bush , ' iraqi dictator saddam hussein reportedly told american interrogators after his capture , a revelation that left bush ' 43 ' surprised .
` words mean something .
... i thought i was pretty clear at times during my presidency and meant it , ' bush said sunday .
` saddam hussein did n't believe us .
so i was surprised .
' ` it was hard in retrospect for me to look back and say , `` i do n't see how he could doubt my word '' .
' the interview aired on cbs during a day when the network was marking the 60th anniversary retrospective of the program ` face the nation .
' bush 's new book , ' 41 : a portrait of my father , ' will ship on tuesday .
it 's a portrait of president george h.w. bush , who served a single term in the white house before losing the job to bill clinton in 1992 .
the younger bush kept the book project close to his vest for years
