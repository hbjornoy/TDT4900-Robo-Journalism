celtic are facing a fifth uefa charge in just three years after european football 's governing body announced it has opened disciplinary proceedings against celtic for ` crowd disturbances ' during their match with dinamo zagreb .
a uefa statement read : ` disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the uefa europa league group d match between gnk dinamo zagreb and celtic fc played on 11 december in croatia .
' it is the fifth time within the last three years celtic have been hit with charges because of the behaviour of their supporters during european matches .
celtic fans let off a flare during their europa league clash with dinamo zagreb in croatia earlier this month .
celtic lost 4-3 to dinamo zagreb but still qualified for the last 32 of this season 's europa league .
after the most recent incident - when an ` illicit ' banner was unfurled at a champions league match with ac milan in 2013 -- it resulted in a # 42,000 fine and the club 's chief executive peter lawwell condemned the ` small minority ' of supporters who were ` damaging the reputation ' of celtic .
a # 4,221 was handed down earlier that year after fireworks were set off by supporters during their champions league qualifier with cliftonville .
the club 's fans also caused them to be fined twice during their europa league campaign in the 2011/12 season .
celtic were fined after fans displayed this banner during a champions league game against ac milan in 2013 .
in march 2012 , uefa fined celtic # 21,000 after supporters displayed an offensive banner and set off flares during an away game with udinese .
celtic were also fined # 13,000 for ` illicit chanting ' in the same competition during a match with rennes in 2011 .
given the high volume of supporter-related incidents , celtic now run the risk of a more severe sanction over and above a financial penalty .
