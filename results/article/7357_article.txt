prince harry has spoken out about how much he enjoyed serving as an equal alongside his fellow soldiers , saying that his stint in afghanistan was ` as normal as it 's going to get ' for him .
he has been pictured helping out with chores at his base in camp bastion , wiping down counters and joking around with other officers .
the prince paid tribute to his comrades who allowed him to get on with his day job in relative anonymity and treated him as ` one of the guys ' .
he was relaxing today after flying out of afghanistan at the end of his 20-week deployment in the country .

joking around : harry drawing a caricature of the soldier who is responsible for making the tea .
while on duty as an apache helicopter pilot , the man known as captain wales shared a room with another pilot in an accommodation block made of modified shipping containers .
when he spent time with the 662 squadron , 3 regiment army air corps , he described the situation as ` completely normal ' , and could use the facilities at his base without being disturbed .
however , when he entered the more public areas of the camp , he admitted he sometimes received unwanted attention .
` for me it 's not that normal because i go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp , and that 's one thing that i dislike about being here , ' he said .
` because there 's plenty of guys in there that have never met me , therefore look at me as prince harry and not as captain wales , which is frustrating .
` which is probably another reason why i 'd love to be out in the pbs -lsb- patrol bases -rsb- , away from it all .
` but yeah , it 's completely normal .
it 's as normal as it 's going to get .
i 'm one of the guys .
i do n't get treated any differently
