arsene wenger expects the world 's leading players to be playing in the premier league after this week 's # 5billion television deal .
domestic television rights were sold to sky and bt sport for a staggering # 5.136 bn across three years , with clubs and players set to benefit .
` it 's an impressive number and it shows the popularity of the english game , ' arsenal boss wenger said .
the premier league could see an influx of big name signings like alexis sanchez in the coming years .
clive efford criticised the premier league for not spending more of its tv rights riches on grassroots football .
` it will contribute to get the best players all over the world to come to england .
` the movement of the players is always linked with the economical and financial power in the countries .
` when i was a coach in monaco we bought the english players because we were the first to have the television money .
` today the biggest financial power is in england and the best players come to england .
' sky sports , whose pundits include graeme souness -lrb- left -rrb- and thierry henry show premier league coverage .
wenger praised broadcasters for their role in boosting english football 's popularity , but there was a note of caution , too .
he added : ` if football is so popular all over the world , the television -lrb- companies -rrb- in england have contributed to it a lot .
` they have to pay heavy money now but they must have calculated .
it looks to be more of a calculation of ` we can not lose this ' than ` we want absolutely to grow and get bigger ' .
` today the difference is so big that the english clubs have a power to attract who they want .
` will that last ?
that 's another question .
