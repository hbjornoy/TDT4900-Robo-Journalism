for days when an ordinary egg timer simply wo n't do , there 's the one which plays different songs when your breakfast is cooked to varying states .
firebox 's beepegg comes in three varieties - original , disco diva and rock god - each of which has three different melodies , which play when your egg has reached varying stages of hardness - soft , medium and hard - alerting you when to take your egg out of the hot water .
songs piped through the quirky # 14.99 gimmick include killing me softly , the final countdown , smoke on the water , celebration , that 's the way and last night a dj saved my life .
scroll down for video .
the beepegg takes the temperature of the water and measures the internal temperature of the egg .
the beepegg plays three different tunes to indicate that your egg is cooked to varying degrees of hardness .
the beepegg beeps once when the water reaches approx 45 Â°c -lrb- to show it 's working -rrb- , once when the water starts to boil , then begins to play its songs as the egg cooks .
its internal thermostat continually measures the water temperature and calculates the inner temperature of the eggs - that 's why you need to put it in the water with the egg .
