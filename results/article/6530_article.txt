after ten-year-old gracie mcnulty 's father died in an accident , she was n't sure how to cope with her first christmas without him .

with the help of her mother and three siblings , gracie served turkey with all the trimmings to 50 homeless people yesterday .

brace : gracie 's father craig had promised to open the family 's cafe to the homeless on christmas day but died after falling from a roof .
his daughter wanted to open the cafe to fulfill his wishes .
her father craig , 38 , was a regular charity volunteer who had served breakfast to the homeless on boxing day in the past , and he had promised to open the family 's cafe on christmas day this year .
but mr mcnulty , a roofer , suffered serious head injuries when he fell while working .
he was taken to hospital by air ambulance but died soon after the accident in august .
gracie 's mother sharon mcnulty , 46 , who runs the grilled and filtered cafe in dewsbury , west yorkshire , said : ` after he died gracie said to me `` i do n't want to have christmas at home this year , i want to do what daddy wanted and open the cafe on christmas day .
` it would n't feel right to celebrate so we 're serving christmas dinner to people who do n't have a home to go to .
' she added : ` we 're all thinking of craig .
it 's all in his honour and he would be so happy with what we are doing .
