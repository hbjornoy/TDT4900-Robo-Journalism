javier hernandez will not be leaving real madrid in the january transfer window , according to the striker 's agent .
the on-loan manchester united forward has failed to hold down a regular place in carlo ancelotti 's side , with much of that down to the superb form of karim benzema .
therefore it has been mooted that the 26-year-old 's season-long loan will be cut short earlier than expected , suggestions which have been rejected by eduardo hernandez .
javier hernandez has struggled for regular playing time since joining real madrid on loan .
the 26-year-old will not be returning to manchester united in january despite reports in the press .
he told as : ` sometimes the media speculate too much and assume situations .
he -lrb- hernandez -rrb- will not leave the club -lsb- in january -rsb- .
` he is eager to play more minutes but he knows that hard work will open up more opportunities .
he has his future ahead of him .
` real madrid are a team full of impressive players and obviously to earn a spot is difficult , but javier has a great quality in working hard , like he has since the first day , and this is his quality .
' hernandez pictured in training for real madrid on the eve of the club world cup semi-final earlier this week .
no decision will be made on chicharito 's long-term future until the end of the season , with madrid undecided if they will exercise the option to sign the mexican on a permanent basis .
` if madrid do not exercise the option to buy it will not be until the end of the season , ' the agent added .
` in any case , we have to consult with the board of manchester united to know what the future holds for chicharito .
