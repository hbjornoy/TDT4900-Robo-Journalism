nearly six decades after it first aired , an i love lucy christmas special was last week 's most-watched holiday program .
there was a gimmick involved : the episode of the 1950s lucille ball-desi arnaz sitcom was colorized .
a companion episode that featured lucy as a grape-stomper in italy also went from black-and-white to color .
lucille ball , center , dressed as santa claus in a colorized i love lucy christmas special , which aired on friday , december 20 on cbs .
lucille ball , who died in 1989 , played a housewife with aspirations of showbiz fame .
arnaz , her real-life husband , played a bandleader who always offered a shoulder to cry on when her schemes met with inevitable disaster .
ball said it was her belief in her character that made her popular .
the nielsen company said on tuesday that the i love lucy special on cbs drew 8.7 million viewers to rank as last friday night 's most-watched program .

runner-up a charlie brown christmas - a relative newcomer that debuted in 1965 - settled for 6.4 million the night before on abc .
cbs was the most-watched network .
but nbc was the most popular among advertiser-favored young adults with help from the voice finale and the nfl bears-eagles game on sunday night football .
earlier this year , a polka dot dress lucille ball wore on the show , which aired from 1951 to 1957 , sold at a hollywood auction for an incredible $ 168,000 .
the pink and brown garment was expected to rake in between $ 40,000 and $ 60,000 , but one i love lucy enthusiast was apparently willing to part with much more for the iconic relic .
the dress is a long , brown silk gown cinched around the waist , with a white collar and light pink polka dots .
i love lucy won five emmy awards and was the most popular u.s tv show for four of the six seasons that it aired , between 1951 and 1960 .
