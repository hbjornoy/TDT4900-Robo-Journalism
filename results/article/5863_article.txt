the state pension is a ` right ' earned over a lifetime and not a benefit , a minister has said .
pensions minister steve webb said the elderly were driven ` up the wall ' by politicians lumping the weekly payment with other welfare payments .
mr webb said the government was going to stop referring to the state pension , worth # 113 a week , as a benefit because of the stigma attached to claiming welfare .
pensions minister steve webb said it was ` shocking ' to lump the state pension in with other benefits .
labour has previously suggested that the state pension could be included in a future welfare cap after the election .
but mr webb said that defining it as a benefit in that way would be ` shocking ' .
he said : ` labour want to put it in the welfare cap , which is shocking really .
if you have an over-spend on -lsb- one benefit -rsb- , then you might cut the state pension to make up the shortfall .
` that completely undermines what the state pension is .
to include it in the welfare cap would be quite wrong .
' the lib dem minister told the telegraph : ` the law refers to the state pension as a benefit and has done since the war .
` as our research shows , it drives pensioners up the wall if you talk about claiming a benefit rather than the state pension .
` absolutely rightly , it is yours by right , you have paid your national insurance contributions .
there 's a certain amount of stigma about claiming benefits , when people draw their state pension that 's not how they think of it .
' the government 's annual ` benefits ' bill is dominated by state pension payments , which accounts for more than # 1 in every # 2 spent on welfare .
the department for work and pensions has accepted that it needs to consider the ` tone and wording ' it uses when discussing the state pension .
the state pension is something that elderly people feel that they have ` built up entitlement to ' by working , the government has said .
