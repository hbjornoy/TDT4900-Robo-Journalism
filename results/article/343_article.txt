fearless : celebrity chef annabel karmel has a spine of steel and the coolest of heads in a crisis .
annabel karmel , celebrity chef , author and businesswoman , does n't look like the sort of person you 'd immediately turn to for help if you found yourself in a tight corner .
she is 51 , petite -- a little over 5ft tall -- fine-boned and glamorous , her blonde hair cascading in a tumble of luxuriant curls .
she 's a doll-like size six , wears a floral pinny and pads round her elegant # 20 million town house in north london in bare feet , her dainty toenails painted vermillion .

she handed it to the police at the crime scene .
the thugs , who had by then terrorised and robbed a string of affluent victims in the wealthy hampstead area of north london -- including a 70-year-old man who they hit with a hammer -- were swiftly identified .

their violent three-month crime spree abruptly curtailed , the trio -- corrie moroney , 23 , alan fitzgerald , 20 and ellis parkinson , 21 -- were this week jailed for a total of 23 years .

` you ca n't !
' she exclaims .
` otherwise , the muggers have won .
they 've got away with it .
i wo n't become a prisoner in my own home because of them .
