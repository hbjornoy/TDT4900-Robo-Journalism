pensioner gwen trickett has cleaned up with the ancient vacuum cleaner she bought bought for a few pounds more than half a century ago .
her blue and grey upright hoover junior is still going strong and has never let her down even after vacuuming her carpets thousands of times over the years .
mrs trickett , 77 , bought a new plastic cleaner ten years ago but used it just once and dumped it in a corner before returning to trusty hoover junior .
it was the first household item that .
great grandmother mrs trickett and husband derek , from worsborough , .

and .
apart from replacing the wire flex she has had to buy just one new bag , .
while the ancient motor continues to power the hoover on her twice .

the hoover junior would have cost mrs trickett # 20 in the mid 1950s which was twice the average weekly wage at the time .
` i must admit i like to get my wear .
out of things but i never thought it would last as long as this , ' said .
mrs trickett , who celebrates her 56th wedding anniversary today .

bought it from a local shop with back tax which was the income tax you .

we have had our moneysworth out of it and a lot more besides .

a metal body so it 's solid .
about ten years ago i bought a new plastic .
cleaner because i thought that my hoover was bound to break down at any .
time but it never has .

starts up every time and still has a lot of suction .
