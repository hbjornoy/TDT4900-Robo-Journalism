low level exposure to traffic fumes is enough to raise the risk of lung cancer , scientists reported yesterday .
air pollution may even have to be added to smoking as a recognised cause of the disease , it is claimed .
lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the uk , claiming almost 35,000 lives in 2010 .
in the same year , 42,000 britons were diagnosed with the disease .
danger : new research suggests even low exposure to car fumes could increase the risk of lung cancer .
an estimated 86 % of cases are believed to be a direct result of smoking .
other potential triggers include exposure to natural radioactive gas from the ground and toxic substances in the work place , such as asbestos .
the new research , reported in the journal the lancet oncology , analysed pooled information from 17 studies in nine european countries .
in total , the data covered almost 313,000 individuals .
air pollution levels were estimated at people 's home addresses and cancer diagnosis rates obtained from national and local registries .
over an average 13 year follow-up period , 2,095 study participants developed lung cancer .
people 's chances of having the disease rose with greater exposure to small sooty particles generated by diesel exhausts which are known to lodge in the lungs .
two size grades of particle were studied , tiny pm 2.5 s and somewhat larger pm10s .
for every density increase in pm10s of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air , the risk of lung cancer rose by 22 % .
for pm2 .5 s , every five microgram per metre cubed increase led to an 18 % increase in risk .
deadly : an estimated 86 per cent of lung cancer cases are thought to be caused by smoking .
the trend was seen below the air quality limits set by the european union of 40 micrograms per cubic metre for pm10s and 25 micrograms for pm2 .5 s , according to the study authors .
lead scientists dr ole raaschou-nielsen , from the danish cancer society research centre , said : ` we found no threshold below which there was
