cheat to victory ?
gus poyet claims uruguay will do anything to beat england at the world cup .
handball referee !
uruguay frontman luis suarez was sent off for stopping a ghana effort on goal with his hands during the quarter-finals of the 2010 world cup .
according to poyet this unscrupulous streak -- drummed into them from birth -- is inherent in the national culture .
just ask ghana -- that 's how they went out of the last world cup in 2010 .
their quarter-final in south africa was tied at 1-1 and into extra time but dominic adiyah 's header in the dying minutes beat uruguay goalkeeper fernando muslera and was going in .
until luis suarez flung his hand at the ball and pushed it out .
it was an instinctive reflex , bred through generations .
the liverpool striker was sent off , but then asamoah gyan missed the resulting penalty and uruguay went through in the shootout .
poyet , who won 26 caps for uruguay said : ` what i 'm going to say is something very , very normal for me and i hope you take it well , ' he says .
' i know that for you a handball on the goal line is cheating .
but not for us .
it 's part of the game .
` like if i 'm the last man and you 're running and i pull your shirt and you go down and i get sent off -- is that cheating ?
no it 's not cheating .
` you guys take it as a last man red card , fine .
we take the same reaction -lsb- for what suarez did -rsb- .
` i know it was massive in england , i know .
but england
