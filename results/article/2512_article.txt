in the depths of the countryside , it is not unusual to find young lambs huddled in front of a fireplace or swaddled in a blanket in a farmer 's living room as they are nursed back to health .
however , it 's not often the newborn lambs begin to favour their newfound human surroundings over grassy fields and hay-filled barns .
but , that 's exactly what 's happened to one youngster , who is now having an ` identity crisis ' after preferring to be more like his dog playmate .

the lamb was unwell when he was born and was cared for by miss burton , being nursed back to good health .
keith now lives with the family and enjoys taking part in activities with the dogs , including walks in the fields .
keith , the ` sheep dog ' , was taken in by anna burton when he was born prematurely at the family 's farm in nidderdale , north yorkshire , in february this year .
miss burton , 19 , only brought the newborn into the house in order to take care of him as he was abandoned by his mother and was a ` very small ' lamb .
since then , keith has adjusted to life indoors and has been spotted stealing food from the dogs ' bowls , watching tv and snuggling up for cuddles with his owner .
miss burton , a college student , said the lamb now gets on so well with the family dog , toby , that they are often found playing together on the farm .
she said : ` he was born prematurely at the end of february this year to a sheep who we thought was having twins , but actually had triplets .
he even shares the dog 's bowl with the family 's other six dogs and likes to spend time in the family home .
miss burton said he enjoys watching tv , having cuddles with her and eating dog food with the other animals .
