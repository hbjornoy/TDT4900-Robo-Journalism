she spends her days in her bedroom , dressed in black or purple , staring at a framed photograph of her late husband , matthew , on the dressing table .
` anyone who tries to lift me out of it has an almost impossible task on their hands , ' says michelle dockery , who plays the recently widowed lady mary -- and new mother of baby george -- in the fourth series , which returns this weekend .

the .
new series begins six months after matthew 's death in 1922 , with lady .
