home to the smallest cathedral in britain , the north wales town of st asaph had been an ecclesiastical city for almost 1,500 years .
yesterday it became a city for real following a royal announcement .
together with perth in scotland and chelmsford in essex , st asaph was awarded city status to mark the diamond jubilee .
the newly classed city of st asaph has a population of around 3,400 - a fifteenth of the size of fellow new city perth .
the trio beat off 22 others to be granted the accolade .
while many of its rivals spent thousands on their campaigns , councillors in st asaph -- population 3,400 -- splashed out just # 300 on their application .
bookmakers were so convinced it would not win that , just a couple of weeks ago , they were offering odds of 33-1 against it securing the title .
yesterday councillor denise hodgkinson , who helped devise the bid , said : ` i was shocked but delighted when i heard the news -- i just stood in my kitchen and cried .
this is the third time we have applied for city status , so it was third time lucky .
i 've never put a bet on in my life -- i wish i had done now .
' st asaph may not be well known but one of its most famous sons is record liverpool and wales goalscorer ian rush .
other notable former residents include : .
to outsiders , st asaph appears like a place that time forgot , with a high street barely wide enough for two cars to pass and no big chain stores or supermarkets .
there is a cattle market every thursday and , unlike the residents of other cities , locals still know their beat bobby by name .
the city 's football team -- st asaph fc -- play in the vale of clwyd and conwy premier league .
their ground , roe plas meadows , is where the council uses a committee room to stage its monthly meetings .
