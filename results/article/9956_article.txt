when faced with a lioness clawing at its flimsy cage , most of us would do a runner .
but valentin gruener calmly approaches the cage - and lets the beast run wild .
as he begins to unlock the door , sirga starts pacing up and down and as soon he opens the enclosure , the big cat springs out and pounces on him .
fortunately , she 's just after a big hug and mr gruener greets the lioness with a pleasant ` good morning ' before rubbing noses with it .
traveller john hawkins shot the video at modisa wildlife project near maun , botswana .
he said : ` val is a wildlife conservationist that raised sirga the lioness almost from birth .
` this guy is exceptionally inspirational .
he takes her on game walks and she can even hunt on her own .
' sirga the lioness greets val gruener who raised her from birth at the modisa wildlife project in botswana .
mr gruener founded the wildlife project with mikkel legarth from germany after they met while volunteering at a nature reserve in 2009 .
the project conserves and protects big cat habitats in partnership with grassland safari lodge .
mr gruener said : ` grassland started their conservation work by capturing lions and other big cats in conflict with farmers to spare them from certain death .
' come here you big lug !

mr hawkins has been travelling the world since 2008 after setting foot in the dominican republic .
last year he travelled through africa .
he said : ` travelling through africa is a very humbling experience that makes you realize how amazing this planet truly is .
