colin birdsall , 72 , who died when his organs failed was due to be buried in a metal coffin last thursday .
a family were left horrified after council officials turned up at their father 's funeral to tell them they could n't bury him in a metal coffin because they are banned .
stella birdsall , 48 , ordered a # 3,000 , vacuum-sealed , navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father colin , 72 , but his funeral in knottingley , west yorkshire was halted last thursday .
she said the service at st botolph 's church ` went beautifully ' but then the official ` ambushed ' the funeral cortege beside the open grave .
miss birdsall , a control room operator , said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached wakefield council 's policy barring the use of metal caskets -- and that she had two options , either to postpone the burial or to change the casket .
` everybody was in a state of shock , ' she said .
` i was dumbfounded .
' ' a council official was on the phone in front of the coffin and no one knew what was going on .
` after about 10 minutes , we were told the council would n't allow us to bury my dad because his casket was metal .
` we were all in total shock .
we were given two options , whether to postpone the burial or to swap dad 's coffin and continue .
` we chose the latter because all the guests were already there , but we never had a choice in the coffin .
' after a hurried discussion , the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker 's parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin .
she said her father 's body was put in a plain , plywood box which was the only one they had in stock .
` there was then confusion over which way my father was laying and he was spun twice over his own grave , ' she added .
` before we left the cemetery , the bulldozers were already filling in the earth .
