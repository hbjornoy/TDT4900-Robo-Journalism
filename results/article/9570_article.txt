hero : joseph hardman , pictured , was giving cpr to a patient , who has n't been named , last friday morning when , on the way to the hospital , he began having severe chest pains .
his union president joe barney said on saturday : ` he dropped his patient off alive while he was having a heart attack , then went to the er , where they treated him immediately .
he survived , and he 's in fact laying three beds over from the guy he brought into the hospital .
' both men had identical stents put in to clear the blockage in their arteries .
doctor michael brown told wxyz that hardman 's blockage was in what they call the ` widow maker ' artery .
he said the odds of an ems technician having a heart attack while treating a heart attack patient were ` one in a million .
' ' i would have to say one in a million is about appropriate , ' brown said .
' i have n't ever seen it and i have n't heard of it .
' er : his partner drove them both to the detroit medical center 's 24/7 cardiac care unit , pictured , and the paramedics dropped off the patient before hardman himself went to the er .
hardman , who has now been released from hospital , said he did not know how serious a condition he was in until his chest pains grew stronger and he began sweating .
he described the pain as ' a sudden explosion-type feeling in my chest .
