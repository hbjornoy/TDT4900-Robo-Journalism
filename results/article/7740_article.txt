` attention seeker ' : mathew davis , 22 , posted a message on the toilet door mid-flight so he could ` save the day ' a british airways steward who wrote a bomb threat on a jet 's toilet door mid-flight so he could ` save the day ' as a hero and get a promotion was jailed for six months today .
` attention seeker ' mathew davis , 22 , was a member of the crew on the boeing 777 flight from london to tokyo with 150 passengers on board when he posted the message claiming there was a live bomb on the plane that was going to explode mid-air .
the note read : ` the bomb on board will explode at 16.00 gmt unless our demands are met ' and he showed it to terrified stewardess sarah jane spencer when the plane was 35,000 feet over the middle east .
she spent the rest of the flight checking her watch believing her time had come but in reality it was a hoax by davis so that he could tell the captain and get a promotion .
judge anna guggenheim qc , who noted it was ` highly dangerous behaviour ' , said : ` this is an extremely serious example of a bomb hoax .

` had you been believed the extent of the chaos and disruption and fear would have been very great indeed .
' davis ` found ' the message and told the captain and ms spencer but luckily the ` highly experienced ' pilot realised it was a hoax almost immediately .
because of the captain 's ` good judgement ' the plane did not make an emergency landing and ` hundreds of lives , international air traffic and emergency services ' were not deployed but he still caused ` extreme fear ' to his colleague , the judge noted .
the note read : ` the bomb on board will .
