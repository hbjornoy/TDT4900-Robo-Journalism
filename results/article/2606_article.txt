nottingham forest manager stuart pearce says jamaal lascelles and karl darlow are being sold to newcastle united against his wishes .
the premier league club are set to complete the double signing of defender lascelles , 21 , and goalkeeper darlow , 23 , but they will be loaned back to forest for the rest of the season .
pearce , though , is not happy with the deal , thought to be worth in the region of # 7million for the championship club .
on the move : jamaal lascelles -lrb- left -rrb- and karl darlow are set to sign for newcastle united .
` we had an offer from newcastle , that i was made aware of last week , in regards to the two players going there , ' he said .
` the figures that were mentioned , by the representative of our club -- i said i would not do that deal , when i was asked the question .
` i thought i could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run .
unhappy : but new boss stuart pearce is disappointed that the pair are due to be sold .
` the first i heard today -lrb- monday -rrb- about things was when jamaal lascelles came in and told me that he had a medical at 2pm at newcastle .
` that disappointed me greatly .
i do not agree with it .
but the only olive branch i have got is that the boys are both coming back on a year loan , which is a bonus .
