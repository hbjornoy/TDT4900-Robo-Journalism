sunshine smile : judy murray waves to the crowds .
her youngest son has only just tied the knot with his long-term partner kim sears .
but judy murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ` ca n't wait to be a granny ' .
however , the tennis coach , who helped propel andy , 27 , and his brother , jamie , 29 , to sporting success , has a couple of caveats -- he has to get the french open and wimbledon out of the way first .
mrs murray , 55 , who has carved out her own star status after appearing on strictly come dancing last year , also said she would be a ` very active granny ' and in the same way she coached her sons , she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis .
she told closer magazine : ` i 'm really looking forward to being a granny .
i 've always wanted to have grandchildren but i had to be patient and let them get married first .
` i 'm not sure when they will have kids as andy has the french open followed by wimbledon , but i know he wants them .
i will be a very active granny , that 's for sure -- and i ca n't wait to introduce them to tennis .
' her words come only a few days after her son and his bride wed at dunblane cathedral on saturday , drawing more than 3,000 well-wishers to the streets of his home town .
writing in the guest book of cromlix house hotel -- a property murray purchased in 2013 for # 1.8 million and where his brother got married -- the happy couple thanked staff for their hard work around the top-secret event and signed as ` andy & kimberly murray ' .
the new mrs murray , who wore a flowing jenny packham gown , wrote : ` thank you to graeme and every single one of you at cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives -- a special place filled with very special people !
