a new attempt to persuade mps and peers to back a right-to-die law has been branded ` orwellian ' by one of the country 's leading lawyers .
lord falconer , the former labour lord chancellor , wants to legalise ` assisted dying ' for terminally ill patients .
but he has been accused of using ` orwellian spin ' by attempting to distinguish between ` assisted suicide ' and ` assisted dying ' .
critics say there is no difference between the two .
lord alex carlile qc , left , said the terms of lord falconer 's , right , bill are based on ` euphemisms ' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as ` assisted dying ' rather than ` assisted suicide ' among his critics was leading liberal .
democrat peer lord carlile , who said that giving doctors power to help .
terminally ill people to die ` would not pass the public safety test ' .
lord carlile , a prominent qc , said in a .
newspaper article : ` advocates of such a law tell us that they are not .
talking about suicide .
they say that helping people who are terminally .
ill to end their lives is not assisting suicide because they are .
expected to die .
` this is , of course , nonsense .
in law , .
as in the english language , if you take your own life , whatever your .
state of health , that is suicide ; and a doctor or anyone else who .
supplies you with the means to do so is assisting suicide .
` sound lawmaking demands clarity .
it can not be based on euphemisms , verbal evasions or orwellian spin .
' lord falconer was also accused of .
exploiting the impact of right-to-die court cases involving terribly .
disabled people to win support for the proposal .
critics said its timing had been .
` carefully planned ' to coincide with the hearing of the case of paul .
lamb , 57 , a severely disabled former lorry driver , who is seeking .
permission for a doctor to kill him
