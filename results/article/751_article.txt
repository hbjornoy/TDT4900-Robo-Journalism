west ham 's ravel morrison has been cleared of assault after charges were withdrawn on thursday .
morrison , pictured at manchester magistrates court last year , is looking for a move away from west ham .
charges that morrison assaulted his ex-girlfriend , reah mansoor , and her mother , parveen mansoor , were withdrawn after his defence team produced cctv footage which showed the alleged assault outside a manchester nightclub last july did not take place .
reah mansoor also withdrew her statement alleging morrison later assaulted her outside her home while there was ` reluctance ' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her .
morrison last night played for west ham under 21s in their league game against everton in southport .
the 21-year-old walks away from court in november after having charges dropped against him .
