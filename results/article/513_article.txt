it should come as no surprise that joe simpson appears wise beyond his years .
the 26-year-old wasps scrum-half speaks with the air of a man twice his age after a year of ` emotional turmoil ' following the tragically premature death of his 58-year-old mother brigid , who passed away last january after a six-month battle with skin cancer .
that simpson has come through as a calm and reflective man , and happens to be playing the best rugby of his life , is testament to him and the club .
` last season was tough , ' simpson said .
` it was an emotionally draining year .
she sacrificed so much for me , driving me all over the country from the age of 10 , to club games and to england camps .
some of the locations were far from glamorous and i remember her standing watching in the pouring rain , all wrapped up .
my family have always been incredibly supportive .

after his mum died , simpson was grateful for the presence of rugby in his life .
` rugby was a brilliant distraction for me , ' he said .
` the coaches , the owner and every single member of staff were magnificent .
they let me take as much time off as i wanted after mum died but i did n't want to take time off .
i 'm a rugby player .
it 's what i do .
` being around the guys , i could temporarily forget things out on the training pitch .
the support i received will stay with me .
it meant a lot to me at a time when i was feeling pretty low .
` i 've come back feeling fresh and i 'm loving my rugby and being part of the rejuvenation of this club on and off the pitch .
i 'm over the moon with how things are going for me .
