christmas day television in 1952 was a rather gentler affair than it is now -- with a much bigger proportion of it devoted to religious programming .
but some things , reassuringly , have endured , not least the presence of bruce forsyth -- and the queen .
a survey has revealed exactly how christmas television has changed over the past 60 years .
radio times analysed bbc1 schedules from 1952 , 1972 , 1992 and 2012 , and found that we are watching more drama and more children 's shows than ever before .
but the proportion of religious programming has declined .
it will make up just 5 per cent of bbc1 's 24-hour schedule this christmas .
at 75 minutes , that 's the same amount of time as in 1952 -- but then it accounted for almost a fifth of programming , as there were only seven hours of content in total .
in 1972 , there were 115 minutes of religious programming .
viewers will watch much more drama this year than in previous decades , with shows such as call the midwife and doctor who accounting for 13.5 per cent -- or 195 minutes -- of the christmas day output .
in 1952 and 1972 , drama did not feature in the schedules at all .
sixty years ago , the highlight of the .
channel 's christmas day output , which began at 11am , was the christmas .
party , featuring frankie howerd , norman wisdom and petula clark .
that .
was a far cry from the bbc 's first festive offering in 1936 , which .
included carol-singing and a turkey carving demonstration .
viewers in .
1952 could watch 90 minutes of comedy , including the laurel and hardy .
film swiss miss. .
this year , there will be 210 minutes .
of comedy on bbc1 , slightly less than in 1992 , when comedy dominated the .
prime-time christmas day schedules .
