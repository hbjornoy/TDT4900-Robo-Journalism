a dog whose only puppy disappeared now walks the streets of a chinese city carrying a board appealing for help to find her ` darling ' puppy .
aidi 's owner , yang fan , said her puppy went missing while he was walking the two dogs in jilin in north-eastern china 's jilin province .
the sign reads : ' i will pay the one who helps me find my darling dog .
' aidi stands with a sign reading ' i will pay for the one who helps me find my darling dog ' mr yang , 65 , was given aidi by his son after he moved away for work four years ago , leaving him to live alone .
mr yang 's wife had died just over a year before , and his son worried his father would be lonely .
he said : ' i was not so bothered at the start about having a dog but must admit we are now very close , she has become one of my family and is a great companion .
' aidi had two puppies , but only one survived .
the missing puppy , said to have been in good health when it disappeared , is now two-and-a-half-months old .
mr yang said : ' i was taking both mother and puppy for a walk , and the young dog was very excitable but always kept close to its mother .
but then suddenly we both noticed it was gone , and although we looked everywhere we could no longer find the puppy .
' mr yang said aidi has always been ` very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for ' mr yang said aidi never gave up wanting to look for her offspring .
` aidi was really upset and the next day when she continued to want to go out searching for the puppy , i decided to make her a sign to carry .
` she has always been very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for , and we have had lots of people reporting sightings but so far none of them have worked out .
but we are getting new leads every day , and i hope we might still be able to find her puppy .
