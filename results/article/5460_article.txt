actress kirstie alley has revealed she fell in love more than 20 years ago with john travolta as she rejected widespread hollywood speculation that the `` grease '' star is secretly gay .
alley , former star of the 1980s tv comedy ` cheers , ' told abc television journalist barbara walters that she fell for both travolta and actor patrick swayze in the 1980s , although she claimed their romances never got physical .
alley , 61 , said she was attracted to travolta while the pair were making the 1989 movie ` look who 's talking , ' calling him ` the greatest love of my life .
' alley and travolta worked together on the hit comedy look who 's talking .

` believe me , it took everything i had inside , outside , whatever , to not run off and marry john and be with john for the rest of my life , ' alley told walters in an interview broadcast on breakfast tv show `` good morning america .
'' asked by walters to comment on persistent rumours about travolta 's sexuality , she said : ' i know john with all my heart and soul .
he 's not gay .
' alley added : ' i think in some weird way , in hollywood , if someone gets big enough and famous enough , and they 're not out doing drugs and they 're not womanizing , what do you say about them ?
' travolta was single at the time , but alley was on her second marriage , so she never pursued her feelings , she explained .
travolta later married actress kelly preston , his wife for the past 20 years .
but the actor was the target of two lawsuits earlier this year , which were quickly dropped , from two male masseurs who claimed travolta made unwanted sexual advances .
alley , who talks more about her love life in her new book , `` the art of men , '' said she fell for swayze while they were filming the 1985 civil war tv miniseries ` north and south .
