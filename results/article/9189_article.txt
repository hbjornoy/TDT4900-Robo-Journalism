an illinois bank robber who escaped from custody and went on a 27-hour crime spree has been convicted thanks to a bragging love letter he wrote to his girlfriend .
robert maday , 42 , was already a convicted bank robber when he wrestled two cook county state 's attorney investigators as they drove him to court in 2009 , getting away with their guns and one of the men 's pants .
he used the guns to commit separate hijackings against two women in chicago 's suburbs before robbing a bank , all while being hunted by police .
after his 27 hours on the lam , maday was re-captured and penned the detailed letter to girlfriend lisa barruzza in custody , according to wls-tv .
it was used today to convict him of all five escape , bank robbery and weapons counts he was facing .
in the letter , maday boasts of his ` so elaborate , so enticing ' plan to evade the authorities after making his getaway but bemoaned how it was foiled before he made it out of the state .

' he wrote to barruzza .
' i had a plan so thorough , so elaborate , so enticing , so ... i wo n't tease you with it now .
