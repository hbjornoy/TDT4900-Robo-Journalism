this baboon was n't monkeying around , it just wanted a ride .
jericho the horse looked less than impressed by the unwanted passenger as he tried to enjoy a lazy afternoon in the sun at an animal sanctuary in plettenberg bay , south africa .
nevertheless , patient jericho gave the cheeky primate a reasonable ride around the grounds of monkeyland and birds of eden , much to the amusement of onlookers .
all aboard : jericho the horse looks rather unimpressed by the baboon who has hitched a ride on his back .
come on up : a baboon gestures to a fellow primate to climb on to jericho 's back and tour the grounds .
that 's the spot : the baboon uses jericho 's rump to seemingly scratch an itch during the ride .
how about a lift ?
the baboon makes friends with jericho , left , and right , appears to be grooming the horse .
the cheeky primate played jockey on jericho 's back and even rolled around , seemingly using the horse to scratch an itch .
monkeyland , which opened in april 1998 , bills itself as the world 's first free roaming multi-specie primate sanctuary and aims to rehabilitate and free previously caged primates .
