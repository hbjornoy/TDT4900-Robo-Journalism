nasa has said there are ` billions ' of planets in our own milky way galaxy - but a new study suggests that the idea that they are teeming with alien lifeforms may just be wishful thinking .
two princeton scientists used what 's known as ` bayesian analysis ' - a technque that ` boils down ' ideas to the actual data , as opposed to scientists ' own ideas about what ` should ' be true .
they suggest that it 's very possible earth is a one-off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet , the chances of life are very low indeed .
the milky way : it contains 100 billion planets , but scientists suggest that it 's very possible earth is a one-off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet , the chances of life are very low indeed .
science fiction ?
princeton scientists suggest that the idea of extraterrestrial life - as in stephen spielberg 's et - is just fiction , and earth 's early evolution of life might just be a ` fluke ' ` fossil evidence suggests that life began very early in earth 's history and that has led people to determine that life might be quite common in the universe because it happened so quickly here , but the knowledge about life on earth simply does n't reveal much about the actual probability of life on other planets , ' said princeton astrophysical sciences professor edwin turner and david spiegel , a former princeton postdoctoral researcher .
` information about that probability comes largely from the assumptions scientists have going in , and some of the most optimistic conclusions have been based almost entirely on those assumptions , ' he said .
` if scientists start out assuming that the chances of life existing on another planet as it does on earth are large , then their results will be presented in a way that supports that likelihood , ' turner said .
` our work is not a judgment , but an analysis of existing data that suggests the debate about the existence of life on other planets is framed largely by the prior assumptions of the participants .
