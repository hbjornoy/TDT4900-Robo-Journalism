` police hold concerns for their whereabouts as it is totally out of character for them not to make regular contact with family , ' a spokesman said in a statement .
mr lonkhuyzen last contacted his wife at taroom on december 11 after he and his sons travelled inland to do some sightseeing .
detective acting superintendent owen elloy said mr van lonkhuyzen may have decided to take his sons camping off-road and become stranded because of recent heavy rain .
he said a massive search has been launched across a huge area of outback queensland .
` we have had police , including those from miles , wondoan and taroom , patrol hundreds of kilometres of outback roads , as well as camp grounds and truck stops , ' he said .
` this is a vast geographical area that we are talking about and many roads are cut due to localised flooding or swollen creeks .
' he urged property owners , station workers and motorists to keep an eye out for the trio .
the family is travelling in a 1995 model white mitsubishi pajero , queensland registration 426 mcz , and they are towing a silver trailer .
the trio left taroom on december 11 and were due to arrive in cairns four days later but never did .
