jailed paedophile : norman shepherd lived a double life .
a mother turned detective to catch the ` monster ' who abused her son by covertly recording him admitting his vile crimes .
she confronted retired dentist norman shepherd , a trusted family friend , after her son , now in his 20s , broke down and told her he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times between the ages of five and 12 .
during the conversation shepherd , 78 , a former churchwarden , admitted the crime -- but when the mother tells him she plans to go to the police , he replies : ` alright .
it 's going to be his word against mine .
' unbeknown to him the entire exchange was being recorded by the mother , against the advice of police who had told her not to go near him .
shepherd was later jailed for 15 years and four months after she helped uncover the perverted double life of the supposed pillar of society .
yesterday the mother , from an affluent area of the home counties , said : ` i had a total determination that the monster will go to prison .
' she said that when her son -- who she described as ` an inspiration who is making a success of his life ' -- first told her of the abuse ` it felt like my heart had been ripped out ' .
on the day her son broke down in september last year she rang shepherd and asked him to explain himself , recording the conversation on a mobile phone .
throughout the exchange , which has been heard by the mail , married shepherd 's tone remains matter of fact as he tries to play things down .
after he says : ` i 'm not denying we were very close ... ' , the mother insists on a face to face meeting with him the next day at his grade-ii listed home in the village of poling , west sussex .
the phone call .
mother : i 've just been talking to my son and he 's broken down ... he 's told me the things you used to do to him as a little boy , and what you did was absolutely unforgivable and i want to know your comments .
