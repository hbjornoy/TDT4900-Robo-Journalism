the row ended with his girlfriend hurling abuse at deschamps on twitter and nasri announcing his retirement from international football .
` from time to time , i 'm a jerk , ' nasri said in an interview with l'equipe 21 .
` sometimes it is better to buckle but it is something i ca n't do .
' i managed when i was younger and sometimes i went home with a knot in my stomach .
afterwards , you go off , but not with the right person .
` i 'd therefore prefer to say everything i think , even if it means i 'm not liked , even if it means i sound arrogant and a little prick .
at least the folk i do like do n't have to suffer .
