england 's laura massaro was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women 's squash final at the commonwealth games in glasgow after a dominant display by malaysian world number one nicol david .
massaro , who was crowned world champion earlier this year after david had been beaten in the semi-final on the other side of the draw , rued a missed opportunity at game point in the opener as david ran out a 12-10 11-2 11-5 winner .
the 30-year-old massaro had made a strong start , building an 8-4 lead in the opener before david hit back , and the favourite surged through the second set with the minimum of difficulty .

there was more pain in the third set for massaro , who needed treatment after being accidentally hit by a david back-swing when she trailed 4-3 .
david , who has won seven of the last nine world titles and reigned as world number one for 99 months , took a stroke which put her 5-3 up and it was a lead the malaysian never looked like relinquishing as she completed a successful defence of her title .
second : massaro was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women 's squash final .
massaro said : ' i think nicol was better .
obviously she was - she won and i did n't .
' i definitely think the first game was the most crucial and i was disappointed not to convert that game ball that i had .
things like that can turn matches .
after that she settled down very well and it was always going to be difficult then .
` physically and mentally she 's tough to break down .
you 've got no chance if you 're not playing the best you could and i would n't say i was at my best today -lrb- monday -rrb- .
` i 'm disappointed .
it was 3-0 and it was n't really close after the first game .
ultimately my goal was to try and get a medal and i never put a colour on it .
a silver is probably about what i deserved .
i 'm number two in
