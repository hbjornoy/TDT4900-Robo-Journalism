they told john cantlie he was in the wrong place at the wrong time .
he almost always was .
in the days that followed the photojournalist 's first capture in syria two years ago he was tortured and tormented by threats of beheading as his captors -- british islamic extremists -- sharpened their knives in front of him .
the one opportunity he had to escape -lrb- it was every englishman 's duty to try , he later explained -rrb- ended in near disaster when he and a fellow prisoner were shot and wounded , escaping death by inches .

taste for adventure : john cantlie , pictured in 2012 , kept returning to war-torn regions , despite the danger .
but that was n't in john cantlie 's nature .
` i 'm itching to get back out there , ' he said soon after returning to the uk .
` this is what i do .
' so he returned and in november 2012 , he was captured again .
cantlie , whose family includes a doctor , army officers and a barrister , has always had a passion for adventure .
his lifelong love of motorcycles led him to become a companion to princes william and harry , riding with them across africa six years ago , and he has reported from some of the most dangerous places in the world .
at the age of 20 , it was n't war zones that beckoned the young cantlie , but computer games .
he cut his teeth on computer game magazines in the early 1990s , when sega was the must-have entertainment .
he moved to a motorcycle magazine before being asked to help relaunch lads ' magazine fhm .
tv work and more bike magazine jobs followed before he decided he wanted to taste more action .

one fellow photographer said : ` he was n't the kind of guy everybody knew .
he seemed to like to work on his own , be his own boss .
