the crew from a coast guard ice cutter have saved a dog that was frozen in lake st. clair in michigan .
the ship was headed to search for any other vessels that could have been trapped in the frozen ice when they spotted a group of foxes surrounding something in the distance .
as they made their way closer to the site , they realized that a dog had become trapped in the layers of ice and was near death .
handling with care : two officers from a coast guard ice cutter came to the aid of this dog who was trapped in this ice on lake st. clair on the michigan-canada border on monday .
` it was cold , weak and tired .
it may have been out there for a couple of days or so , ' chief petty officer alan haraf told the detroit free press .
` they noticed three burrows the dog tried to dig for itself for protection .
they said the paws were bleeding and the nails were pretty much down to nothing .
' three petty officers on board the ice cutter , called the bristol bay , packed on their cold weather gear and rescued the dog .
the dog , which the crew members nicknamed ` lucky ' , was wearing a collar and harness but did not have a tag .
making a stop : the boat was looking for stranded vessels when it spotted a group of foxes that had surrounded this dog .
once the dog was brought back on board using a stretcher , he was warmed up by the officers and fed some chicken breast .
the ice breaker headed back to detroit from there and one of the officers took it to a local veterinarian .
the vet was able to determine that the dog was a mixed breed and about 11 years old .
it still remains unclear how the dog got out onto the ice and how he became stuck .
` hopefully he 'll find a home .
he 's such a darn good dog , ' petty officer brian essler told the detroit free press .
