on christmas day , marie buchan 's eight children will unwrap dozens of gifts each presented to them in a giant sack and then have a festive feast in their new four bed home .
like any parent , their 33-year-old mother , from birmingham , wants them to have it all and enjoy a perfect christmas .
however , the unemployed single parent has n't paid for any of it .
their lavish christmas and new home is all thanks to british taxpayers .
scroll down for video .
determined to spoil them : single parent marie buchan has bought all her children 's christmas gifts with her # 2,227 a month benefits .
the family receives # 2,227 a month in benefits -lrb- # 26,724 a year -rrb- .
marie is adamant her children deserve everything they get .
' a lot of people will see this and once they are all wrapped think `` how dare she , she 's on benefits and she has all these presents for her kids and we only have two or three for ours because we are working full time and ca n't afford it '' .
` but everyone deserves a christmas and why should we on benefits not be able to ?
for my children not to be able to open a present on christmas day because we 're on benefits , it 's just not right , there should n't be a stigma for that , ' she told channel 5 documentary benefits britain : life on the dole .
but marie is n't just giving her children one present , she 's showering them with gifts even though buying them plunged her into rent arrears .
big family : the young mother is raising tia , 12 , leah , 11 , latoya , nine , joshua , eight , alisha , six , mikayla , four , amelia , two , and olivia , one .
wo n't miss out : marie does n't want the children to have just one present because she 's on benefits , so they will each have a sackful - even though buying them meant she missed rent payments .
at one point in the show , which airs this evening , she looks at the piles of presents and complains that some of her children do n't have enough
