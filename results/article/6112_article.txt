edwin van der sar believes brazil are the favourites to win the world cup because they will be able to handle the conditions the better than any other team .
luiz felipe scolari 's side are going in search of their sixth world cup and will have the advantage of playing at home .
and former dutch keeper van der sar , who won 130 caps for his country , says brazil are the team to beat .
close shave : edwin van der sar believes oscar , daniel alvez and the rest of the brazil squad have the best chance .
going all the way : with players like fred and neymar , brazil have emerged as favourites .
van der sar told laureus sport : ' i think brazil are clear favourites because of the weather , the humidity , the warmth , the expectation from the people .
` and besides , there are so many good football players that they can put two or three teams in the world cup .
so i think it will be very hard for an outsider , or maybe a european team , to get to the final and try to win it .
i think brazil will win for the sixth time .
' but when it comes to individual star , the ex-manchester united keeper is in no doubt who will shine , he added : ` my friend cristiano ronaldo .
i played a couple times against him in 2006 and 2008 .
we always lost and i think it is fair to say that ronnie could well be top scorer of the tournament .
' van der sar has also tipped england 's joe hart to have a long and successful career ahead of him -- despite suffering difficulties earlier this season when he was dropped by city earlier in the season .
van der sar added : ' i think sometimes it is not bad to have a period that you are making mistakes and maybe you are on the bench for a couple of games .
shinning star : cristiano ronaldo is tipped to be the stand out player by van der sar .
tipped for the top : van der sar is expecting big things from ronaldo .
` maybe that helps to bring back your focus and the desire and the will
