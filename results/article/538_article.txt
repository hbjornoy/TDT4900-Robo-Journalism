sickening attack : luke harwood , 18 , was severely beaten at his bedsit before being driven to a field and ` finished off ' , the court heard .
a woman led a vigilante gang who tortured an 18-year-old to death after he was accused of rape , the old bailey heard .
emma hall , 21 , helped three men kill luke harwood in romford , essex , after an 18-year-old girl claimed he had attacked her two years earlier , the court was told .
mr harwood was kicked and stamped on with such force that the bones in his face were broken , before he was dumped under a mattress in a quiet lane , the old bailey heard .
the ` victim ' had made a complaint about mr harwood to the police two years earlier , when she was 16 , but the matter was dropped when she withdrew the allegation , jurors learned .
police investigated but found that ` it was clear she was not in fact saying that he had raped her and no further action was taken against him ' .
the girl pointed mr harwood out to his killers at a chance meeting at a house on the evening of may 27 last year , said prosecutor simon denison qc .
` she told the others that he was the person she had told -lsb- hall -rsb- about at the time , who had raped her , ' added mr denison .
james danby , 27 , and jovan roberts , 28 , took pictures of mr harwood in his council bedsit to show to her .
minutes later , they attacked him in his room , the court heard .
mr harwood , who was 5ft 7in and weighed just seven stone , had just collected his keys and begun moving in after falling out with his girlfriend .
the father of one , who had an eight-month-old son , was then brutally beaten by danby , roberts and hall 's boyfriend tony o'toole , 29 , the prosecutor said .
mr denison said : ` within a very few hours of those photographs being taken he was dead .
