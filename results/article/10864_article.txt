budget : sally shephard , pictured , bought a week 's worth of fresh food for just # 5.60 , or 80p-a-day .
a 29-year-old woman proved you do n't need to break the bank to eat healthily - buying a week 's worth of fresh food for just # 5.60 .
sally shephard carefully planned her 80p-a-day menu and raided markets and supermarkets for the best deals on fresh ingredients .
and she even had change spare for a pork pie at the end of the week .
miss shephard , from newcastle , said her aim was to live on the same budget as those who live below the international poverty line and raise money for impoverished communities in kenya .
her three meals-a-day diet consisted of core ingredients such as carrots , onions and rice that were bought at the beginning of the week .
and rather than indulging in costly alcohol or fizzy drinks , miss shephard washed her meals down with glasses of hot water .
she said the meals , which included omelettes , potato cakes and soups , were n't that different to what she would usually eat , and said it proved it was always possible to eat healthily - even on a shoestring budget .
miss shephard , who is due to become a special needs worker next month , said : ' i bulk bought bags of potatoes and rice and bought fresh fruit and vegetables from my local market .
' i was never hungry and i had loads of money left even after i 'd bought myself the ingredients .
` my diet during those seven days was n't that different to what i would have normally and i had good , big healthy meals .
' on day four of the challenge , miss shephard used the # 2.24 she had in change from her main buy at the beginning of the week to pick up spinach , a cabbage and six eggs from the market .
and on day seven , miss shephard even had enough money to buy a pork pie that had been reduced to 45p .
she finished the week with five potatoes , five onions , more than half a kilo of rice , a slice of bread , two thirds of the cabbage and some butter - and still had 9p
