in the one and a half years they have been married andrew and erica holloway have never argued , have no secrets and are more in love today than the moment they met .
yet incredibly this melbourne-based couple , both aged 30 , have never consummated their marriage - and erica admits that she has no intention of ever doing so .
for while andrew would love to rip his wife 's clothes off , erica is in fact still a virgin and reveals to the daily mail online that the very idea of making love to her husband is a complete turn off rather than a turn on .
unique arrangement : erica and andrew holloway have been married since october 2012 but have never had sex because erica is ` repulsed ' by the idea .
' i wish i wanted to have sex with my husband , ' erica , a graphic designer , explains .
` but i do n't and i know i never will as , while i love him , the idea of sex repulses me .
` we are still very affectionate with each other and love to hold hands and kiss and cuddle , but that 's as far as i could ever go .
` people might think our marriage would be a disaster because of this , but we are as happy now as the day we met .
' erica has known since the tender age of 15 that she was asexual - after realizing that she had never felt sexually attracted to anyone .
and despite trying to force herself to feel some kind of sexual desire towards a few men in her late teens , she admits that she failed to ever feel the kind of connection that so many of her peers seemed to experience .
at this point , erica had almost given up on ever finding love , as , perhaps unsurprisingly , most men she met ran a mile when she told them about her total aversion to sex .
` it was such a frustrating period of my life as i knew i was different , i just did n't know why , ' she recalls .
` all my friends were experimenting with boyfriends , yet when i even kissed a boy , it just left me cold .
