a judge ruled that a severely anorexic and alcoholic woman should not be force fed and kept alive after she wrote to him saying : ' i am prepared to die ' .
the woman , suffering an ` unusual ' combination of anorexia nervosa and alcohol dependency , wrote to mr justice cobb to tell him she wanted to spend whatever time she had left ` doing nice things ' .
in the moving letter , presented to the court of protection , she said ; ` whatever time i have left i just want to live each day alongside my granddad and -lrb- siblings -rrb- , who are my world .
' i want them to know `` me '' rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together .
' in a moving letter , presented to the court of protection , an anorexic and alcoholic woman has begged not to be force fed , saying : ` whatever time i have left i just want to live each day alongside my granddad and -lrb- siblings -rrb- , who are my world ' mr justice cobb , who described the case as ` unusual and desperately sad ' , said no one involved could be identified to protect the woman 's privacy .
the woman told him that she was ` fully aware ' of what was wrong with her and what the ` effects of my wish to refuse treatments ' would be .
the judge , who was told that the woman 's life was in ` imminent danger ' , ruled last month that she should not be force-fed or forced to have treatment following a hearing in the court of protection - where cases involving sick and vulnerable people are analysed - in london .
but detail of her letter did not emerge until today , when mr justice cobb published a written analysis of the case .
the judge , who described the woman as ` young ' , said anorexia nervosa had dominated her life for the past 14 years .
he said a ` psychological dependence ' on alcohol had caused ` end stage ' irreversible liver disease .
she had been trapped in an ` increasingly destructive revolving door of treatment and recurrent illness ' and had been admitted to hospital more than 45
