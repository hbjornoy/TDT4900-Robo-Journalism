claims : dave lee travis , pictured arriving at southwark crown court today , says he had to sell his house to fight assault allegations against him .
dave lee travis told a court he has a ` cuddly nature ' but denied being a ` sexual predator ' .
speaking from the witness box yesterday , the former radio 1 dj said he ` loves women ' because they are ` wonderful ' and have ` fabulous shapes ' .
the 68-year-old said he did not have a predatory nature with women , but admitted he did ` hug a lot of girls ' .
` if i like someone i will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that , ' he told the court .
` perhaps hugging is something which can be misconstrued by some people or if people are looking for an excuse they can say `` he touched us '' .
i did hug a lot of girls .
` but nowadays you ca n't do that apparently ... so it is an unfortunate trait i suppose .
' travis described his colourful career as a ` big name ' dj at radio 1 -- but told southwark crown court he could not do what he wanted .
travis spoke of his passion for photography and admitted he has taken pictures of naked and semi-naked women for a book he published .
but he insisted that the pictures were not ` tacky ' and said he did not use his hobby to prey on women .
` i love women , ' he told the jury .
` i think they are wonderful .
' he added : ` women just have such fabulous shapes and i wanted to utilise those shapes .
' among the allegations against him , travis is accused of sneaking into a radio 4 studio and groping a presenter as she introduced woman 's hour live on air in the early 1980s .
denying the attack , he said : ` i would be at a bit of a loose end understanding it to be quite honest with you .
' he said he would have been hauled before a station boss if he had dared to interrupt a radio 4 programme .
