this was just the second time in three years england manager roy hodgson has dared to venture to the stadium of light , but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back .
it was n't only the three lions contenders -- saido berahino and jermain defoe - who failed to impress , every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next .
referee mike jones and his assistants were equally inept , failing to send off west brom 's joleon lescott early in the game and later denying sunderland a legitimate goal .
sunderland 's danny graham -lrb- right -rrb- went down under a challenge from defender joleon lescott -lrb- left -rrb- in the fifth minute .
adam johnson -lrb- centre -rrb- had a goal ruled out for offside for sunderland against west brom in the first half .
sunderland players felt lescott -lrb- third right -rrb- of west brom could have been sent off for a foul on striker graham .
sunderland 's seb larsson -lrb- right -rrb- and adam johnson -lrb- second left -rrb- were incensed at the decision made by jones -lrb- centre -rrb- .
but despite appearing to be the last man for west brom , lescott -lrb- left -rrb- was only booked by referee mike jones -lrb- centre -rrb- .
