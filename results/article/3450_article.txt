danny cipriani is primed and ready to make his long-awaited england comeback next month .
the sale sharks star was pictured looking focused in training with stuart lancaster 's side on monday ahead of their international against the barbarians on june 1 .
while his inclusion in this squad does n't guarantee a place on next month 's tour to new zealand , cipriani appears to be knuckling down .
telling them what 's what !
danny cipriani is back in the england fold ahead of the tour of new zealand .
having a dart : the sales sharks star was pit through his paces as england trained in teddington .
all smiles : cipriani is in line to play against the barbarians at twickenham on june 1 .
and lancaster does n't see bringing him back into the hold as a risk .
` i do n't view it as a risk , ' he said .
` it is an opportunity .
ultimately , selection will be affected by how effective danny is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan .
` if he 's good enough he 'll get the opportunity to go to new zealand and if he 's not quite ready he 'll hopefully play in the barbarians game -lrb- at twickenham on june 1 -rrb- as the beginning of his return to international rugby .
` i 've spoken to him in part -lrb- about team culture -rrb- but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp .
i 'll arrange a one-on-one with every player .
danny 's might be a little bit longer .
but of course he can train his way on to the plane .
all the players can .
' a new man ?
picking cipriani for this squad is n't a risk according to head coach stuart lancaster .
