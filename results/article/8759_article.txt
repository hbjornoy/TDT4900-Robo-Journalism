a bowel cancer patient told he had just 18 months to live claims he has been cured by cannabis oil .
david hibbitt , 33 , was diagnosed with the disease in july 2012 and underwent chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel .
doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for # 50 a gram .
now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in january - and puts the class-b drug down to his miracle recovery .
david hibbitt , 33 , claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer .
in desperation , he tried cannabis oil , which he now credits with his recovery .
he is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years heather martin , 26 , at a registry office today .
mr hibbitt , from stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , said : ` friends had told me about cannabis oil and i dismissed it at first .
i 've never been into drugs .
` but in february last year i was told i only had 18 months to five years to live , and i felt i had to try everything i could .
' i felt like the chemo was killing me and i had nothing to lose .
i could n't accept i was going to die .
' after going online to research his options , he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it .
' i pay around # 50 for a gram from a bloke i know who makes it , ' he said .
` that lasts me about a month usually .
` it gets your pretty high and knocks you for six , but it 's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy .
` the pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job .
' i just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there .
' mr hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles .
