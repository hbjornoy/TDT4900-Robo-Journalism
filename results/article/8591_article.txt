ivan rakitic and stephane m'bia took post-match shirt swapping to a new level on wednesday night as the pair decided they also wanted each other 's shorts after croatia defeated cameroon .
despite rakitic 's croatia thrashing m'bia 's side 4-0 and eliminating the indomitable lions from the world cup , the two former sevilla players could still share a friendly chat before stripping down to swap kit .
both players were vital to sevilla 's europa league success last season , but unai emery 's will almost certainly lose both players with rakitic signing for barcelona and m'bia returning to parent club qpr .
