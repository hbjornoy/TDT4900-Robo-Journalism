bayern munich might have thrashed roma 7-1 in the champions league but their coach pep guardiola still was n't satisfied on tuesday night .
the german title holders celebrated their win with a private audience with pope francis at the vatican on wednesday morning but guardiola insisted his side could still improve and that mistakes had been made in the stadio olimpico demolition .
and all this despite pope francis apparently telling a bayern delegation they had played ' a wonderful game ' and admitted his ` surprise ' at the margin of victory .
