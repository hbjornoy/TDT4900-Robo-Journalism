it was , perhaps , a christmas miracle .
while melony gallagher , a cat owner from plymouth , slept soundly in bed on christmas eve , her beloved pet suki was , she believes , out enjoying a magical ride .
for , according to the readings from her high-tech gps collar , she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of plymouth in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph .
journey : suki , pictured , was found on christmas day with her g-paws tracker hinting at a magical ride .
and with father christmas in the air doing his festive rounds , ms gallagher was left with only one conclusion to draw - that suki had hitched a ride on his sleigh .
although there were no other signs of a supernatural journey on the nonplussed moggy , nor even a whiff of reindeer , ms gallagher discounted the possibility the g-paws tracker had malfunctioned , and spread the word of her yuletide mystery .
posting on facebook the next day , she said : ' i live alone , was asleep in bed and my cat had the unit on at the time this was recorded.the top speed was 183mph !
` she went from my street to a location miles away in the middle of a river , then back again for a while then again to another location miles away in one minute , travelled over rooftops and then home again !
log : the readings from the g-paws device show the route suki is supposed to have taken - in a straight line over the rooftops of plymouth .

' however , the makers of g-paws were not in the mood for
