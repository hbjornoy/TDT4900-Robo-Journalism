a ` miracle ' baby who was born at just 24 weeks and spent the first year of his life in hospital is finally thriving .
doctors would not have attempted to save aiden mclaughlin , who weighed less than 1lb 5oz when he was born , if his birth had come just days earlier .
aiden 's father , sean , who lives with his wife kelly and aiden , now 18 months old , in middlesbrough , said : ` everything had been going fine during kelly 's pregnancy .
aiden mclaughlin was born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 5oz and his parents , sean and kelly , were warned he might not survive .
they family are pictured with nurse angela reay -lrb- back -rrb- .
` on friday 13 , in july 2012 , she started bleeding and lost a clot and we actually thought it was the baby .
' the panic-stricken couple called an ambulance which took them to middlesbrough 's james cook university hospital .
it was n't until they were at the hospital that they were told the baby was still safe .
mrs mclaughlin was given two lots of steroid injections to help develop aiden 's lungs in case he made an early arrival .
` it was a massive relief to find out that the baby was ok , ' said mr mclaughlin .
` we actually also found out that kelly was 2cm dilated .
' aiden was born on july 16 , 2012 , at just 24 weeks and three days as doctors could not halt mrs mclaughlin 's labour .
aiden was born at just 24 weeks and three days at the james cook university hospital in middlesbrough , as doctors could not halt his mother 's labour .
mr mclaughlin said : ` they said to us that the baby would be out in 24 hours .
they also said that the baby might not make it through .
` they had to give him oxygen to try and make him breathe .
` three minutes into doing it we heard a little cry .
` it was just overwhelming as everything had been quiet up until that point .
` it was like looking at tom thumb .
it was just a little miracle that he was there .
