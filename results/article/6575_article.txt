derek wildeman , 42 , was savagely beaten at his home in blackburn after telling a boy off when his curtains were set on fire .
a man with learning difficulties who told a teenage boy off for setting fire to his curtains was beaten so savagely he will never be able to speak or look after after himself again .
derek wildeman , 42 , was attacked by steven quigley , 31 , and his uncle gary quigley , 43 , after he shouted at a 13-year-old boy over vandalism to his terraced house in blackburn , lancashire .

eight months on , he still needs 24-hour care and his mother says his life is effectively over .
the attack took place on february 24 this year , when mr wildeman noticed at midnight that someone had reached through his boarded-up window and set fire to his net curtains at the home he shared with his two dogs .
he put the flames out and went onto the street , where he saw a boy walking past with two friends .
