louis van gaal has helped shaw rediscover his fitness by holding regular talks with the full back .
the former southampton defender missed the start of the season with a hamstring injury and was publicly criticised by manager louis van gaal during pre-season for failing to meet his high fitness standards .
however , shaw has now taken van gaal 's criticism on board and is ready to establish his place in united 's first team .
` there 's a lot of pressure on me because i arrived here for a big fee and there 's attention that comes with that , ' he told the daily mirror .
` of course , he was right to say that .
we had a discussion in pre-season and the plan was to get my fitness up .
it worked , i think , apart from the injury .
he 's been a great inspiration to me .
` the manager and i talk at the training ground and we have discussions .
i feel in good shape .
