duncan had helped transport a pregnant woman suffering from ebola to a hospital in liberia , where she was turned away for lack of space .
he then helped bring the woman back to her family 's home and carried her into the house , where she later died .
four other men who had contact with the woman , whose name is believed to be marthalene williams , died soon after as well .
four days later duncan flew to the united states , lying on his questionnaire about having any contact with an infected person before he left liberia .
there are still roughly 50 people being monitored after having come into contact with duncan , 10 of whom are considered at ` high risk .
' the disease can hide in the human system for up to 21 days .
high risk : an unidentified man and a woman are seen leaving duncan 's apartment building .
this all comes as cdc officials rushed to newark airport earlier today to meet a man on a flight from brussels who was vomiting and ` showing signs of ebola .
