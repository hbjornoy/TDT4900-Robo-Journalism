a furious mother has hit out after a council-run café tried to charge her 80p for a jug of hot tap water to warm her baby 's milk .
gemma cawte had already spent # 9.60 on lunch for herself and her daughter bella , five , on an outing to riverside country park in gillingham , kent .
but when the 31-year-old asked staff at the café for some water to warm the milk for her five-month-old son jack , she was told it would cost 80p .
ms cawte had spent all her money buying lunch and was forced to feed the milk cold to the tiny baby - and the youngster promptly threw it up .
medway council says the cafe is run under a lease agreement and that it has no control over the pricing .
but civic chiefs have asked for the people that run it to reconsider charging for warming baby bottles .
ms cawte , of chattenden , kent , said : ' i asked for some hot water and they said they could n't give me any because of health and safety .
` when i asked if they could put it in some hot water behind the counter instead .
' i was told i would have to pay 80p , the same price as a cup of tea .
we had only taken # 10 out with us .
` it is madness .
i thought they would have been more helpful considering it was a family place .
` the woman in the cafe was n't apologetic at all .
she just looked at me and said no she could n't do it .
' i was angry and upset .
i had to give him it cold and he just ended up puking all over me .
