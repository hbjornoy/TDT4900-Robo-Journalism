this morning i woke up alone again , as i do every morning .
i nipped down to the kitchen to make a plate of hot buttered toast and brought it back to bed , where i switched on the radio , lay back and tucked in , happily scattering crumbs all over the sheets .
my husband tom and i had n't had an argument , nor is our sex life a thing of the past .
quite the reverse .
ever since my husband and i decided to sleep in separate bedrooms five years ago , our marriage has been happier and more fulfilling than ever .
` best thing i ever did ' : rachel is highly pleased with the restorative effects sleeping in a separate bedroom to her husband has had .
as i listened to tom 's footsteps in the hallway , i smiled mischievously as i recalled our wonderful ` date ' in his bedroom yesterday evening , which ended with a kiss goodnight before i tiptoed back to my own boudoir .
i 've always believed that deciding to sleep alone was the best thing i ever did .
and this week i learned that i am in some very good royal company .
in an interview , princess michael of kent revealed that she and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms so they are ` fresher ' for each other .
since they 've been married for 35 years , they 're clearly doing something right .
sharing a marital bed is a peculiarly british thing .
continentals are far less keen , and america 's national association of home builders says 60 per cent of new homes are likely to have dual master bedrooms by 2015 .
so why do it ?
well , please understand , i love my husband dearly and the physical attraction between us remains as strong as the day we met .
but between his snoring and my fidgeting , we just could not get along while we were sharing a duvet .
tom and i met in 2001 when i was a political correspondent for gmtv and he worked at the ministry of defence .
