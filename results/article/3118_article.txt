they have been spoiled for goalscorers down the years at anfield , but even those fortunate enough to have lived through the ian rush and kenny dalglish years will seldom have seen anything to match an attacking masterclass from luis suarez on wednesday night .
there were supposed to be cracks appearing in the liverpool push for a champions league return after a recent dip in form , culminating in a widely and fiercely criticised defeat at hull on sunday .
instead , the cracks were in norwich 's defence and how suarez exploited them with a 19-minute hat-trick that earned him a standing ovation at half-time and another when he reappeared for the second half .

screamer : luis suarez opens the scoring at anfield against norwich with a stunning volley from 40-yards .
celebration : the uruguayan wheels away jubilantly , and that would n't be the last time , either ... not again : it was a tough night for canaries ` keeper john ruddy who must be sick of the sight of the striker .
