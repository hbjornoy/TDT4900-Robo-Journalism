heading for a new start : but west ham have seen a # 4million bid rejected by sunderland .
on his way out : wickham is set to the black cats after recent rumblings by manager gus poyet .
sunderland want to recoup the # 8million they paid ipswich town three years ago but the hammers -- mindful that wickham has one year to run on his current deal -- have offered half that sum .
the england under 21 star has never agitated for a move away from the stadium of light but has been forced to assess his options in light of his ongoing contract dispute .
wickham scored the goals which kept sunderland in the premier league last season and , with the squad light on attacking options , his departure would be a blow on the eve of the season .
north-east rivals newcastle are also keen on wickham but sunderland would be reluctant to let him join the magpies in light of jack colback 's move to tyneside earlier this summer .
