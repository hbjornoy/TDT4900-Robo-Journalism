in 1957 the thames was so polluted it was declared ` biologically dead ' , meaning the amount of oxygen in the water fell so low that life could not survive and if anyone fell in , authorities would have to quarantine them .
now , thanks to a massive clean-up operation , anglers and wildlife fans are reaping the benefits .
one lucky fisherman is rick hodson , who has just caught a 9lb cod and won the thames fishery research experiment , an annual competition held to check the size and variety of species in the river held by the city of london .
it was this big : mr hodson may have trouble convincing his friends he landed the huge cod .
mr hodson , 67 , caught the monster fish at denton , near gravesend in kent , has entered the competition 38 times and in all that time has never even heard of a fish that big .
he told the evening standard : ` it was just a lucky fish .
i was after whiting .
' the retired insurance broker will eat the fish with his wife shirley .
other fish caught at saturday 's event were two pouting , three dab , 24 flounder and 520 whiting .
the thames has roughly 125 species of fish , while more than 400 species of invertebrates live in the mud , water and river banks .
it now ranks among the cleanest metropolitan tideways in the world .
john woods , chairman of the london anglers association said it was now fairly common to find cod in the thames water .
he said : ` it depends where you are fishing along the thames but where there are large concentrations of salt water , closer towards the sea , it is quite common .
` it also depends on the time of year and during the colder months they are easier to find .
people have been catching cod in the thames for years .
' the thames has undergone a startling transformation in the last fifty years , and now boasts an abundance of life .
