there are a number of hand gestures used around the world that people recognise , regardless of what country or language they 're being used in - such as tapping your wrist to ask for the time , or writing in mid-air when asking for the bill .
however , the rise in technology is seeing an number of new , tech-related gestures achieving similar global recognition , according to research from hp .
for example , the european study found 89 per cent of people can correctly identify the finger swiping motion for ` the next page ' - and this exceeded the 83 per cent of people who identified the gesture for asking for a drink .
tech firm hp asked 6,000 people across uk , france , germany , spain , italy and russia to identify nine hand actions .
they included traditional , everyday gestures such as ok , established tech gestures , including ` texting ' , and more contemporary gestures , such as ` next page ' and ` scroll down ' pictured .
hp surveyed 6,000 people across the uk , france , germany , spain , italy and russia , and asked each participant to identify nine different actions .
the first three were traditional , everyday gestures including the ok sign , made by pressing together a thumb and index finger , raising an imaginary glass to ask someone for a drink , and tapping a wrist to ask for the time .
the next three were established technology gestures including holding an imaginary telephone to the ear to signify ` call me ' , tapping a thumb rapidly to mimic texting , and typing on an imaginary keyboard when discussing emails .
