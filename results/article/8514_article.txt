as you 'll know by now , carl froch 's spring fight with julio cesar chavez jnr has been put back because carl has injured his elbow .
it 's heartbreaking for carl because he desperately wants a las vegas fight before he hangs up his gloves , but i am already looking at the possibility of rescheduling for a summer fight against chavez .
other fights such as bernard hopkins and gennady golovkin have also been discussed - we will see how it plays out .
from carl 's point of view , this latest setback is tough to take .
we were so close to getting all the details in place for a march 28 fight , but three weeks into training he hurt his elbow .
he is the consummate professional and has fought injured before but he wo n't make that mistake again , especially for what might be his last bout .
carl only made the call to postpone last week so now he will take some time to digest that and in the meantime i 'm looking at the options .
this setback has been frustrating for all of us .
i have worked on it for months .
carl froch wants to fulfil one of his dreams by fighting in las vegas before he hangs up his gloves .
froch 's march 28 fight with julio cesar chavez jnr -lrb- left -rrb- has been postponed because of injury .
a fight against gennady golovkin has been discussed - but money will determine the route he goes down .
a chavez fight still appeals a lot to us and whatever route we go the deal has to be right .
that will be key in whatever fight he takes , whether it is against chavez , hopkins , golovkin or anyone else .
carl is a warrior -- everyone knows that .
and that is why he would love to fight golovkin .
it would be a fight for the ages but both men would need to be rewarded for that .
those details need to be right .
likewise against hopkins -- they are great names and great fighters but so is carl so the deal has to suit all parties .
watch this space because carl will be going out with a bang .
one man waiting in the wings is james
