qpr midfielder joey barton has revealed a death threat sent to him by a french fan during his time at marseille .
the outspoken englishman spent a season on loan at the ligue 1 outfit in 2012/13 , but according to a letter posted on twitter , was not adored by the entirety of marseille fans .
it appears the author of the ` fan-mail ' does n't count english as his first language , as the abusive piece is littered with grammatical inconsistencies , at one stage telling barton he would ` die a knife ' .
joey barton posted a letter he received from a marseille supporter to social media site twitter on wednesday .
barton gives a thumbs-up to the marseille fans during his time on loan at the ligue 1 club in april 2013 .
the man ordered the one-time england midfielder to leave marseille before june 1 2013 - which , coincidentally , he did - or to face the consequences .
the letter , addressed to marseille 's training ground , la commanderie , said : .
` if you 're not ... i will come to you specially marseille smash your head shots baseball bat .
and then i will finish and you 'll die a knife open mouth once emptied your blood b ****** .
` do you understand ?

'' d'ue wansum ?

, ' before risking punishment by posting a picture of the sender 's address to his 2.8 million followers .
the move could land him in hot water , as posting personal details without permission is a violation of twitter 's privacy rules .
