an earthquake has struck the rutland area of the east midlands again , just 24 hours after a similar tremor shook houses in the area for ten seconds .
initial data released by the british geological survey -lrb- bgs -rrb- said the latest 3.5-magnitude quake , the biggest in the region since october 2001 , struck the oakham area at around 7:50 am today .
yesterday 's 3.2-magnitude quake occurred at 7:07 am and reportedly shook houses .
today 's earthquake struck at 7:50 am , just 24 hours after the previous one hit at 7:07 am on 17 april , causing some alarm for members of the public .
the uk is not itself generally associated with earthquakes .
however , according to the bgs , 20 to 30 tremors are felt every year , while a few smaller ones are tracked by sensitive instruments .
while most are small and cause no damage , there is the potential for larger ones in future .
the uk does not lie on a major fault line , but it 's thought that smaller unseen fault lines , known as blind fault lines , are deeper underground .
nearby tectonic boundaries such as that between eurasia and africa can induce tremors in smaller fault lines like the ones in the uk .

` if you look at your hand , imagine the main lines as a major tectonic boundary , ' glenn ford , a seismologist at the bgs , explains to mailonline .
` between these are little lines , and if you gently squeeze your hand you see that even these smaller lines move back and forwards .
' while today 's earthquake was large for the uk , tremors are a common and largely unnoticed occurrence across the rest of the world .
it is estimated that 17,000 to 20,000 earthquakes of this size occur every year in the world .
however , seismologists think that a larger one could strike the mainland uk one day and cause significant damage .
` this particular one was 3.5 which in uk terms is quite significant , ' says ford .
` we maybe get one or two a year of that size .
