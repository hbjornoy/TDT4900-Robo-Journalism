an eco-conscious gardener who packed a trailer full of grass cuttings was turned away from a recycling site - because he was towing it on a bicycle .
retired ray duggleby was told by council officials that only motorised vehicles were allowed at the site for health and safety reasons even though pedestrians were walking around .
the 66-year-old has accused the council of hypocrisy - claiming they only promote recycling when it is convenient for them .
health and safety : ray duggleby , 66 , was told he could n't use facilities at a recycling site in weel , yorkshire , because he was using a bicycle which posed a health and safety risk .
mr duggleby had already filled up the brown waste bin supplied by the council for garden waste after trimming the hedges around his home in beverley , east yorkshire .
the keen cyclist then adapted his trailer to fit on his bicycle so he could tow the green waste to the recycling centre in weel , beverley .
but he was stunned when he was told he could n't bring his bicycle on to the site because of health and safety laws .
he said : ' i just could n't believe it .
i thought i was doing the right thing but then they told me that `` you 're only allowed in if you 're towing your trailer using a car '' .
` they said my bike classed as a wheelbarrow , which i could n't understand because you do n't push it .
risk : a spokesman for east riding of yorkshire council , which runs the recycling facility pictured above , said the site would be dangerous for a cyclist because it has a ` constant flow of traffic ' ' i like to cycle , it 's good for the .
environment and i do n't believe in fly tipping .
i try to do as much as i .
can to encourage my neighbours to recycle and i thought that the .
council wanted to be as environmentally friendly as possible .
` after this i feel as though they actually only want to recycle if it 's easy
