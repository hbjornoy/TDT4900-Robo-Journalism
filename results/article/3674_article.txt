julie jones describes the day her best friend died as ` the worst day of my life ' .
but she did n't have time to grieve .
the single mum-of-three had agreed to adopt caroline atkin 's three boys and two girls who had been orphaned by the loss of both their parents within six months of each other .
caroline was given 12 months to live when she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in april 2009 .
adopted family : julie jones with her best friend caroline atkin 's .
children , from left , michael , 12 , emma , 8 , chantelle , 6 , james , 10 .
and kieran , 11 .
tragically , her husband , david , 44 , died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage just nine months later in january 2010 .
when an increasingly ill caroline , 45 , was left worrying about what would happen to her children when she too passed away , she asked julie if she would care for her children - an agreement they dubbed their ` plan b ' .
caroline passed away a few months later in june , and julie kept to her word and took all five children into her home - putting the three boys in a tent in the garden until she could get her house re-organised and turning her dining room into an extra bedroom .
julie , 46 , is now mum to her own children christian , 14 , peter , 18 , and adam , 20 , as well as michael 12 , keiran , 11 , james , 10 , emma , 8 and chantelle , 6 - and she still works full time .
the remarkable family are also in close contact with caroline and david 's eldest son tim , 17 , who lives with relatives in lincolnshire .
julie 's describes her incredible undertaking as ` natural and ordinary ' .
she said : ` caroline and i met on the first day of secondary school , i was her chief bridesmaid and godmother to most of her kids .
` she put in her will that she wanted me to become legal guardian to the kids so no one could take them away
