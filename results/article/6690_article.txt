rollers are ready .
ease of use : the rollers have a lovely velvet feel and take only two minutes to heat .

the clips do get a little hot to handle , but thankfully they do n't burn your head .
rolled out easily after 15 minutes .
result : delivered a nice overall bounce rather than cascading waves .
not for lovers of really big hair if yours is quite long .
