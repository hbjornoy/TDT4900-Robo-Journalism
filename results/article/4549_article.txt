this lion cub tried to tuck in to a tortoise , but found the shell was a tough nut to crack .
playtime almost turned into snack time for the young lion , who clearly had n't heard that it 's bad manners to play with your food .
the cub was discovered tormenting the leopard tortoise by a photographer in the mashatu game reserve in botswana .
a photographer spotted this young lion cub 's unsuccessful attempt to crack in to a tortoise at the mashatu game reserve in botswana .
villiers steyn had been observing the cub playing with its siblings when it got distracted by a potential meal .
but the young lion soon found that the leopard tortoise was not for eating , to its evident annoyance .
villiers steyn , 31 , said : ` the pride was very relaxed and we spent about an hour with them on this particular day .
` when .
we arrived the cub was already playing with the leopard tortoise , so i .
started taking photos immediately , making sure i did n't miss a thing .
' the leopard tortoise is the fourth largest species of tortoise in the world so the lion was certainly taking on a mouthful .
but even its ferocious fangs were n't powerful enough to pierce its victim 's armour .
the youngster wanted to turn playtime into a mealtime but picked the wrong creature to mess with .
the lion found that even a few licks could n't soften up the tortoises 's protective shell .
the cub 's frustration at not being able to chow down on the leopard tortoise was written all over its face .
even though the big cat had a firm grip on the tortoise , its intended prey was n't going to give up without a fight .
` after it urinated in its mouth , the lion left the tortoise upside down , ' said mr steyn .
` we rushed over and turned it up right after the cubs moved away .
' ` yuck !
' : the cub was clearly unhappy that the tortoise retaliated by urinating in its mouth .
