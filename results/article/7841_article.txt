the commonwealth games have been hit by yet another drugs scandal after former world champion amantle montsho tested positive for a banned stimulant following the women 's 400 metres final on tuesday .
the 31-year-old botswanan , who lost her world title in moscow last year to britain 's christine ohuruogu by four thousandths of a second , is the second athlete to fail a doping test in glasgow .
nigerian weightlifter chika amalaha , 16 , has already been stripped of her gold medal in the 53kg category after her a and b samples showed traces of a banned diuretic and masking agent .
doubt : amantle montsho -lrb- right -rrb- has failed a drugs test , the commonwealth games federation has announced .
montsho 's a sample was found to contain methylhexaneamine , a banned stimulant that gives the body an energy boost by increasing its metabolic rate .
the 2010 400m commonwealth champion , who has been provisionally suspended after finishing fourth on tuesday night , has asked for her b sample to be tested in london on monday .
jamaican sprinter yohan blake , usain bolt 's training partner , missed the 2009 world championships in berlin and served a three-month ban after testing positive for methylhexaneamine , which can be found in some dietary supplements and is commonly used as a nasal decongestant , in june that year .
nigerian sprinter damola osayemi was also stripped of the 2010 commonwealth 100m title after traces of the stimulant were found in her system .
a spokesman for the botswana team said : ` there is nothing clear for now .
` we 're hoping that in a few days we will see where it came from and what 's going to happen .
it 's not that she 's been banned , just that she 's suspended prior to the investigation .
' making sure : the 31-year-old will have her b sample tested on monday .
