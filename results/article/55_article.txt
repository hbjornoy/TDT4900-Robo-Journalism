sevilla sporting director monchi expects federico fazio to join tottenham after they agreed to pay his buyout clause of # 8million .
monchi said : ` it seems that tottenham is willing to pay the clause .
we are waiting to see the money -lrb- paid into -rrb- the league .
` we are not going to negotiate with anyone .
two months ago we talked about his renewal , but it was not possible .
show me the money : tottenham have been told they must pay # 8million to sign federico fazio from sevilla .
international : the 27-year-old fazio has played for argentina , representing his nation on two occasions .
` when an english team appears interested in one of our players it is difficult because they can multiply player salaries .
' the former under-20 argentine international can play in holding midfield but it 's in the centre of defence that he makes best use of his impressive 6ft 4ins frame and where he helped sevilla to european glory last season .
experienced : fazio stands at 6ft 4ins tall and he has made 179 appearances for spanish side sevilla .
sevilla signed fazio as a 19-year-old in 2007 from ferro carril oeste and his imposing physique but elegance on the ball drew comparisons with gerard pique at barcelona .
injuries have not been kind to him since then and his career stagnated before emery arrived at sevilla .
