dog-loving minister greg barker has acknowledged that putting his pet dachshund 's pillow-like ` warming pad ' in the microwave at his whitehall office was never going to be the smartest move .
mr barker 's colleagues at the department of energy use the same microwave to heat their tea and coffee -- and one of them made an official complaint about his ` unhygienic ' behaviour .
although he has apologised , the energy and climate change minister is adamant he has no plans to stop taking his pet to work from time to time .
