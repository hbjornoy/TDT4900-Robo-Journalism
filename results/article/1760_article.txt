former tottenham hotspur striker jermain defoe is understood to be open to a premier league return .
hull city manager steve bruce admits defoe is very much on his january transfer window wishlist .
` if he becomes available , which i believe he is , then we 'd love to do something , ' bruce said after hull 's 2-0 win over everton on new year 's day .
' i think it might be too expensive but it 's not a bad bit of speculation .
` there 's always speculation .
you ask any club in the bottom of the division about defoe , all of us would say yes .
whether we can do it financially is another problem .
' defoe moved to toronto for # 6million from tottenham last january , and the england striker with 55 caps has also been linked with queens park rangers .
hull put 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by beating a miserable everton in a manner not properly reflected by the 2-0 scoreline .
` it 's been probably our best performance , ' bruce said .
` we 've seen glimpses of it but from the first minute to the 90th there was a determination that it was going to be our day .
` it was the most convincing .
we deserved to win the game by a country mile .
' defoe applauds the tottenham crowd during one of his final home games during his first spell in 2009 .
