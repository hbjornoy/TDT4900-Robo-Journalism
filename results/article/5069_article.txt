antiquities including vases , jewellery , bronze statues and frescoes were recovered after police uncovered a criminal network that trafficked classical treasures out of italy through switzerland .
the archaeological treasures that were discovered by the italian carabinieri military police were displayed during a press conference at the terme di diocleziano museum in rome .
prosecutors say the basel-based dealer gianfranco becchina and his wife , ursula juraschek , are part of an art smuggling ring stretching from ` tombaroli ' grave robbers in southern italy , to buyers across the globe .
dealers produced forged certificates of authenticity and created fake histories for them , so that museums and private collectors could buy them in good faith , police said .
the works were restored in switzerland before being sold in germany , britain , the united states , japan and australia .
becchina was detained by italian police while his wife was arrested by swiss police .
authorities have promised to put the 5,361 works , dating from the eighth century bc to the third century , on show to the public before they are returned to museums .
