lord lucan 's widow was pictured in belgravia , central london , where she lives yards from the murder scene from nearly 40 years ago .
hiding behind large sunglasses and swathed in a full-length black coat , the countess of lucan went practically unnoticed as she walked through the streets of central london .
pictured days before a new itv drama is to air about the lord lucan mystery , his wife veronica , 75 , was spotted in belgravia , where she lives in a small mews house close to the murder scene .
nearly 40 years after since the murder of the family 's nanny in what was believed to have been a botched attempt to kill lady lucan , a new documentary will claim the 7th earl of lucan was murdered by the criminals he had hired to help him escape the murder .
lady lucan , who bore the peer three children , refused to cooperate with the producers of the drama , entitled lucan , as did her lawyer daughter , camilla bloch .
she is thought to have been the target for the murderer who killed her children 's nanny , sandra rivett , at their home in lower belgrave street .
lady lucan was herself badly injured in the attack and when she was able to make a statement afterwards , she named her husband as the man who attacked her and killed their nanny .
last month she said : ` i do n't think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment .
` the film is based on the most absurd book i have ever read on the lucan affair so i did n't think it was sensible to have anything to do with it .
' her daughter , lady camilla bloch qc , who was four when her nanny was murdered and her mother attacked , said : ` as a lawyer i hope it 's not old-fashioned to point out that my father never stood trial .
it is unfortunate that he is regularly referred to -- in almost factual terms -- as a murderer .
