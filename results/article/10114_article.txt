ben azarya -lrb- pictured with the print -rrb- 14 , was given the print with a distinctive autograph by a man who introduced himself as robin banks - a name linked to banksy .
he signed a print of a flower thrower , with a distinctive autograph and gave it to the helpful 14-year-old telling him to ` have a good life ' .
ben had no idea who banksy was until he got home and looked him up on the internet .
he said : ` he was on the phone for most of the time talking to someone called ak47 .
` he opened his rucksack and had a gas mask and spray paints inside .
he got out a piece of paper and had colours marked on it of what he had been trying out and he dropped his colours .
` banksy ' signed the print of a flower thrower with a distinctive autograph -lrb- pictured -rrb- and gave it to the helpful schoolboy telling him to ` have a good life ' it was only after ben went home and researched banksy , that he began to realise the significance of his encounter .
' i picked them up for him and after that he started signing it in weird letters and numbers .
he said ` do you know who robin banks is ?
' .
' i said no and he said ` this will be worth about # 20,000 - have a good life , brother ' .
' sadly though , it looks like the schoolboy will be disappointed as the real artist has come forward to say it was n't him .
a spokeswoman for the elusive graffiti artist said : ` it has got nothing to do with him .
he does n't know anything about it .
