a drink-drive case against a swedish man of asian origin collapsed at court after the defence lawyer pointed out that he 'd ` read on the internet that asians process alcohol differently ' .
the 63-year-old man was charged after a petrol station attendant in karlskrona , southern sweden , claimed to have seen him behaving in a drunk manner while filling his car up .
when police tracked him down and breathalysed him , he was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 1.64 per millilitre , eight times over the legal swedish limit of 0.2 millilitre .
breathalysed : an asian driver was found to be eight times over the limit but was acquitted , with the court stating that how alcohol is processed is determined by ethnicity .
he was charged despite the man 's friends telling police that he 'd had 18 centilitres of whiskey since arriving home .
the accused denied the charges from the beginning .
when the judge acquitted him , he noted that it could not be proven that he 'd driven his car while under the influence .
the asian man had denied the drink-driving charge from the beginning , with his friends claiming he was over the limit because he 'd been drinking at home .
the judge also noted an observation put forward by the asian man 's defence lawyer , that how alcohol is processed depends on ethnicity .
he told swedish paper nerikes allehanda : ` i read on the internet that it differs between different kinds of people .
` native americans and asians have a completely different metabolism and way of processing alcohol than western europeans .
