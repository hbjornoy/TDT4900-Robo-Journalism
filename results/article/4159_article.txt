we 've divided the premier league into teams from the north and south of england - with welsh side swansea included in the south .
rob draper had the choice to pick any players from the south teams , in any formation , with no limit on the number of players from each club .
here 's how we split the clubs : .
south .
arsenal , aston villa , chelsea , crystal palace , leicester city , qpr , southampton , swansea city , spurs , west brom , west ham united .
north .
burnley , everton , hull city , liverpool , manchester city , manchester united , newcastle united , stoke city , sunderland .
north vs south .
it is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of england .
but without dipping into the political allegiances , property prices and weather , we 're sticking to the ultimate debating point -- football .
this week we are starting a new north vs south debate - who would you pick and who would win ?
in the nba , each season they stage an all-star match that pits the best from the west against the cream of the east .
and would n't it be fascinating if the premier league adopted a similar event ?
kicking off today , rob draper selects his south xi - plus seven subs .
a full explanation of the criteria is below .
tomorrow , joe bernstein will reveal his north xi .
then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at football manager .
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... chelsea are top of the premier league , and they provide the back-bone of our south xi to face the north .
goalkeeper : thibaut courtois -lrb- chelsea -rrb- not much to say -- either him or david de gea as goalkeeper of the season , so he 's a natural for the southern no 1 slot .
right back : nathaniel clyne -lrb- southampton -rrb- you can wrestle this one back and forth with branislav ivanovic who has been superb .
but i want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving clyne the nod
