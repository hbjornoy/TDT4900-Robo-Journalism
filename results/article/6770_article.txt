stuart lancaster has warned his england team that samoa will arrive at twickenham determined to win their ` cup final ' .
successive defeats to new zealand and south africa have transformed saturday 's qbe international against the pacific islanders into a critical fixture as the red rose attempt to end a five-test losing run .
samoa 's players had considered boycotting the game due to their concerns over the mismanagement of their union and while that threat has been withdrawn , they are eager to make a statement at england 's expense .
england coach stuart lancaster instructs his squad in training ahead of hosting samoa on saturday .
` we 're expecting physicality , pride and passion from samoa .
this game is their cup final .
it 's a great opportunity for them and they 'll be hugely motivated , ' head coach lancaster said .
' i watched them beat wales in cardiff a couple of years ago -lrb- 29-16 in november 2012 -rrb- in a similar fixture .
they are very difficult opposition , so we need to be at our best .
` it will be incredibly competitive right from the start .
just look at the wales v fiji game last weekend ... fiji almost won it -lrb- losing 17-13 -rrb- .
` we know it 's not a game we can take lightly whatsoever because they 'll be putting us under pressure .
' george ford will be under the spotlight as the bath fly-half comes into the starting line-up at twickenham .
owen farrell , during kicking practice , has been displaced by ford -lrb- left -rrb- to inside centre for the samoa test .
