an ` inspirational ' son died in the arms of his adoptive family from injuries he suffered 21 years earlier when he was ` thrown into his cot ' as a baby , an inquest heard .
joshua cawley , 22 , was born a healthy baby boy but developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy , vision problems and epilepsy after a vicious head injury when he was aged just 10 months .
at an emotional inquest in bolton , greater manchester , his adoptive parents blamed joshua 's ` ticking timebomb ' condition on the alleged abuse he suffered as a baby .
the parents told the hearing that no one should live such as short life and die in such a tragic way .
the inquest heard that joshua 's birth family were charged in 1990 with causing his head injury by throwing him into his cot but a judge in london kicked out the case due to ` evidential differences ' .
his adoptive parents lynn cawley and ruth wood said joshua 's death had left a ` big hole ' in their lives , adding : ` we consider ourselves privileged to have been allowed to care for joshua .
` however , we are mindful that joshua only came to us as a result of the shocking abuse he suffered as a child .
` while the inquest process has been painful for us , we are grateful that this verdict marks a recognition that joshua should not have lived and died in the way he did .
