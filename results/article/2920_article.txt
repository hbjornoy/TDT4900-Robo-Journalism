mauricio pochettino might have given up hope of qualifying for the champions league , but harry kane wo n't hear any of it .
the 21-year-old , who became the youngest premier league captain this season during the drab goalless draw against burnley on easter sunday , still retains belief they can gatecrash the top-four party .
