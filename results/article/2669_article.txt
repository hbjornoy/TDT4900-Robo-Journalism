christian atsu can be everton 's secret weapo in the second half of the season , says roberto martinez .
roberto martinez likes the winger 's qualities and says he will get used to the premier league .
` we need to give him a little bit of time to adapt to the physicality of the premier league just like any player but especially a winger , ' martinez told the liverpool echo .
` in other leagues referees allow less contact and they are a bit more protected .
` but i think the way he has adapted to the way we want to play so far has been impressive .
he 's an intelligent footballer .
` it 's just making sure i can give him the right introduction to his role .
with the minutes he 's had so far in the europa league and other games he 's done well .
` i expect him to be himself in the second half of the season and he can be a very important player for us .
