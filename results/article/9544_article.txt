crystal palace rounded off a promising pre-season with a solid but unspectacular performance against german side augsburg .
tony pulis ' men bounced back well after conceding three times against brentford in their last game , their only defeat of the summer , but were unable to break down the resilient bundesliga outfit .
augsburg finished eighth in the german top flight last season , and so proved a real test for the south londoners , who travel to the emirates stadium to face arsenal next week in their premier league opener .
but pulis ' men were more than up to the challenge , keeping a clean sheet and even having the better of the game 's limited chances , in particular when the second half substitute dwight gayle turning in a glenn murray cross before being correctly brought back for offside .
challenging trip : marouane chamakh battles daniel baier for the ball as palace ended their pre-season .
frustration : pulis gives orders to his men but they were unable to break down the organised germans .
