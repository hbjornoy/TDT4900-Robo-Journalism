ask me if i 'm a bag or a shoes girl and i 'll say shoes every time .
they are the first thing i notice about another woman 's outfit and the one thing in my own wardrobe i 'll splash money on .
furthermore , after years working on glossy women 's magazines , i like to think i can spot designer shoes at 30 paces .
from the cut of the leather to the detailing and shade of the dye , i 've always believed it was easy when it came to sorting budget from luxury labels .
or so i thought .
in the past few months i 've been taken in by more bargain basement styles than i care to mention .
so , am i wasting my money on designer footwear ?
should i be heading for the budget shoe departments this spring ?
and can cheap shoes ever be as comfortable as expensive ones ?
i decided to find out .
my challenge was to road-test five key styles for this season - in each case trying on one pair costing less than # 30 and another with a three-figure price tag .
could you tell the difference ?
french sole -lrb- right -rrb- failed to live up to its # 10 competitors from bhs -lrb- left -rrb- .
snake ballerina pumps .
bhs : # 10 french sole : # 120 .
style : french sole is the rolls-royce of flats , loved by kates moss and middleton .
i buy a pair every spring and wear them so often i feel i can justify the cost .
so , it 's remarkable bhs 's snake-effect fabric -lrb- left -rrb- looks very like the french sole leather -lrb- right -rrb- and is almost as butter soft .
who 'd have thought cheap shoes could be so chic ?
cut & fit : the front of the bhs shoe comes much higher up the foot , which could cause blisters .
but they are wide across your feet , meaning you will keep the circulation in your little toes .
as with a real ballet shoe , the drawstring on the french sole style can be tightened to give a perfect fit .
winner : bhs .
almost identical to its asos -lrb- left -rrb- rival the russel
