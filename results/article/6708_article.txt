student debt : greg dash , 25 , said he has taken 290 pre-orders for his # 65 cameras in just one month .
student and photography buff greg dash was inspired to create his own tiny fish-eye camera after finding his budget would n't stretch to a pricey new lens .
now the welsh phd student 's university debts look set to become a distant memory - with orders for the 25-year-old 's miniscule gadgets pouring in from as far afield as taiwan .
mr dash said he has sold 290 of his # 65 cameras - which measure just over 4cm long and 2cm high - since he began taking pre-orders last month , all but wiping out seven years ' worth of student debt in just four weeks .
his lofi fish-eye camera - which mr dash has billed as the world 's first digital fish-eye lens - has become a hit thanks to its ability to produce expensive-looking photographs despite having just 12 megapixels , one button and no lcd screen .
` i 've always been a fan of photography from a young age , but only ever used film cameras , ' said mr dash .
' a friend bought me an slr camera a few years ago , and i wanted to get a fish-eye lens for it .
` however , as they cost hundreds of pounds and me being a student i had virtually given up on the idea .
` but then i thought instead to make my own one using old camera parts .
' the aberystwyth university student , who hails from mountain ash in south wales , was inspired by lomography - the growing analogue camera movement - in developing his own tiny creation , which has no viewfinder or screen to view photos .
it can shoot high-quality images and hd video , and has a built-in lithium battery which can be charged via a usb port .
miniscule : the student 's tiny camera measures just over 4cm long and 2cm high , but still produces expensive-looking photographs .
` one of the things i first loved about it is that it does n't have an lcd screen
