the ball slammed into a defender 's head before bouncing off and sailing through the uprights .
the lucky bounce took the dell rapids a 38-0 lead over their south dakota rivals milbank high school .
clearly , their luck did n't end there as the dell rapids went on to win the game 51-0 .
a video of keegen scoring the lucky extra point has gone viral on youtube , with close to 400,000 views .
big sioux media 's matt larson had live-streamed the game and realized that he had recorded a once in a lifetime play and immediately posted the clip online .
although relatively common in soccer , an ` own goal ' is almost unheard of in american football .
milbank high school were already trailing 37-0 when kicker keegen hemenway lined up for the extra point .
' i did n't know how to react , ' keegen , an 18-year old in his senior year , told the dell rapids tribune .
` once they said it was good , i was just pumped .
as long as it gets through -lrb- the goal posts -rrb- it counts .
' keegen said he was shocked by the surprise goal but added that his classmates think it 's a bigger deal that he does .
` they wo n't stop talking about it , ' he told the paper .
` people will come up to me and say ` hey , you 're famous .
' but it was just one play .
' the ball hit the crossbar and sailed through the uprights to give the dell rapids an extra point .
since play like this is so rare , there was some confusion initially whether the extra point should be allowed .
