cleaning up : nick grey , who poses with his cordless invention the gtech , is the new james dyson .
rumour has it that it 's practically impossible to get into the dyson headquarters without myriad levels of security clearance .
so secretive has the high-powered -lrb- in every sense -rrb- world of vacuum cleaners become that fear of espionage is rife .
dyson employees must use a fingerprint scanner to enter the building and , even then , access to most research areas is only for a select few .
so when the man tipped as the next james dyson leaps in front of me as i reach for a door handle inside his domestic appliance empire , it 's not a surprise .
` i 'll need to get that , ' says nick grey .
of course , he will .
are we talking fingerprints here , too ?
eyeball scanning ?
am i going to be denied access until i swear not to divulge suction secrets to the russians ?
well , no .
it 's turns out we are just talking a temperamental door .
` it 's a bit stiff , ' he says cheerily , yanking it open .
welcome to the surprisingly low-tech world of gtech , the little vacuum cleaner company that is taking on the big boys of dust-busting .
have you even heard of gtech ?
well , it is short for grey technologies , a name which even mr grey , 45 , admits does n't have the pizazz of dyson .
` it 's not a very good name , is it ?
' he frowns .
` but i could n't think of anything .
people do n't know how to pronounce it .
our customers phone up and say `` i need a battery for my getch '' .
' all of which makes the success of gtech 's flagship product , a lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner called the airram , even more unlikely .
the airram may look unprepossessing , and its inventor admits that it was designed with the elderly market in mind .
` the first customers were in the over-80 age bracket , ' he nods .
but , as unlikely as it sounds , this machine has been , er , wiping the floor with the opposition with 32,000
