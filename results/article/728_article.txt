it 's hard to criticise a referee , but the elite group are told by management that they can not defend the indefensible .
with manchester united cruising and destined for three points , clattenburg somehow missed what appeared to be a clear foul on rafael by vardy -- and to compound the error then gave the softest of penalties when the brazilian recovered and brushed the striker off the ball .
