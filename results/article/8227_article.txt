mark hughes and sir alex ferguson never saw eye to eye during their spell together at manchester united , however the stoke boss turned to his former manager for reassurance that sparked his management career back into life .
hughes , who takes his stoke side to blackburn where his management career began on saturday in the fa cup fifth-round , endured a turbulent spell in charge of free-spending queens park rangers before being sacked in 2012 after just 11 months in charge .
as a result hughes turned to ferguson , who he played under between 1988-95 at old trafford , and points to a 90 minute chat with the scot that reinvigorated his desire to take charge of a side again .
mark hughes has impressed as manager of stoke since a torrid spell at the helm of queens park rangers .
` as a player i did n't ask too much of sir alex , really .
i did n't need to have a relationship with him to be honest , ' hughes told the sun .
` i talked to him just before he retired .
i went to see him after the qpr thing just because i had never done it before .
i asked his advice , we talked football .
i thought it was something i would regret if i did n't do it because i was never the kind of player that would knock on his door and say `` can i have a word , boss ?
''' hughes was grateful ferguson gave him so much time and hailed it as a turning point : ` sometimes you just need a bit of reassurance , ' added hughes .
` ` he assured me in terms of where my standing was in the game and that was good , he 's a huge influence .
it was something i needed to do and i 'm glad i did it .
