spozhmai , the 10-year-old afghan girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint last week , has said her father and brother forced her into it .
a ten-year-old girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint in afghanistan wearing a suicide vest has said how her father and brother forced her to do it .
the girl , named as spozhmai , has said her relatives beat her before telling her to put on the vest .
she says she was treated like a slave at home , and forbidden from learning how to read and write .
spozmai , who is thought to be the sister of a prominent taliban commander , says her father has ordered her to return home but that she has refused .
speaking to the bbc , she added : ' i said : `` no , i will kill myself rather than go with you .
'' ' ` the same thing will happen again .
they have told me before : `` if you do n't do it this time , we will make you do it again .
'' ' i did all the things at home , i cooked , i cleaned the whole house , and they would treat me badly as if i was a slave .
' the case first came to light last week when the afghan interior ministry said police had apprehended the young girl who had intended to carry out a suicide attack against afghan border police in southern helmand province .
she was said to be in a state of shock and confusion at the time .
in a statement , the interior ministry said the girl claimed her brother , a local taliban commander , had sent her on the mission .
according to spokesman sediq sediqi , one of the afghan soldiers spotted the girl wearing a suicide jacket .
but she was arrested before she could carry the attack as she struggled to operate the detonator .
the girl has now been transferred to the provincial capital of lashkar gah .
in 2011 an eight-year-old girl died .
