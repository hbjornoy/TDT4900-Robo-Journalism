a former senior courtier has claimed that bowing and curtsying for the queen is ` not necessary ' as her majesty is ` very relaxed ' about it all .
dickie arbiter , who spent 12 years at buckingham palace and clarence house as press secretary , also said in a new memoir that people do not even have to wait for the queen to speak first when they meet her .
in the book , on duty with the queen , he said : ` what may have befitted the social mores of the 18th and 19th centuries was n't necessarily right for modern times .
` bowing or curtsying when in the presence of a member of the royal family ?
not necessary .
not unless one chooses to .

` but there is no hard and fast rule , and if you ca n't do it or do n't feel comfortable doing it or do n't want to do it that 's fine , it does n't mean you hold the queen in any less respect and you wo n't be sent to the tower .
` the queen is very relaxed about it , she does n't make rules , she understands that some people feel comfortable doing this sort of thing and others do n't .
` the whole thing about waiting for the queen to speak first is also a myth .
' in any event , it seems that the bow or curtsy could lose out in popularity to the selfie .
the queen posed for her first ` selfie ' during a trip to northern ireland in the summer - but has admitted she finds the phenomena of people filming her on their mobile phones rather strange .
