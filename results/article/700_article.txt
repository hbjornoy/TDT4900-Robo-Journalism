a war veteran aged 99 lay helplessly in pain on the floor of his sheltered accommodation for two and a half days after a free intercom service that could have alerted staff was cut to save just 42 pence a day .
former desert rat harold lee feared he would die alone after he fell face down and was unable to get up or call for help .
a pendant alarm the great-grandfather was carrying landed out of reach when he collapsed .
neglected : harold lee , pictured left this week and right while serving in the desert rats , was left lying on the floor of his home for two days after his intercom was cut off .
on duty : the second world war veteran , pictured in 1942 , has been ` let down ' , according to his son .
and his intercom -- through which he .
had been getting a call every morning from a manager to check he was ok -- .
had been disconnected weeks earlier after he refused to pay a new 42p .
daily charge imposed in council funding cuts .
the widower , who lost his wife mabel .
two years ago , was saved only when his grandson jaa , 24 , came to visit .
him and found him on the floor .
mr lee 's son jules , 63 , said the .
family felt ` extremely let down and disappointed ' at the way the second .
world war hero has been treated .
` it could have been fatal had he not .
been found , ' he said .
` this is a man who made this country what it is by .
going to war so you would think he 'd be worth 42p a day .
' mr lee , who .
has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren , maintained yesterday .
that he would not pay the new charge because it had been ` thrust upon .
him ' and had not been part of his agreement when he moved in .
