nottingham forest are in talks with hull about a potential loan deal for tom ince , but face competition for his signature from derby and blackburn .
reds boss stuart pearce is keen to breathe new life into his side 's promotion push , following a seven-match winless run in the sky bet championship , and he hopes to sign the 22-year-old winger on an initial month-long loan .
ince , who pearce knows well from his time as england under-21 manager , joined hull from blackpool in the summer but has found first-team opportunities limited at the kc stadium and has not been involved in steve bruce 's squad for the past month .
tom ince has struggled to make an impression since joining hull city from blackpool this summer .
stuart pearce is keen to complete the signing quickly , before his side 's next game against huddersfield .
pearce , who has worked with ince with the england u21s , is keen to bring in the winger on a short-term loan .
the tigers ' exit from the capital one cup could see bruce allow a number of his fringe players to leave on loan and get games , and pearce is hopeful of completing a deal for ince ahead of forest 's league game at huddersfield on saturday .
however , derby , who sit top of the championship , and blackburn , level on points with forest and just outside the play-off places , are also interested .
forest 's run of five draws and two defeats has seen them slip from the top of the table down to seventh place , although injuries to key players such as andy reid , jack hobbs and chris cohen have not helped pearce .
forest have n't won a game in over a month , falling off the pace in the championship after a good start .
ince has played just four times since his summer transfer , and is yet to score a premier league goal for hull .
