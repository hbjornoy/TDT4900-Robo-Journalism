a 64-year-old man has told how he passed out after a heavy night drinking and woke up to find that his penis was missing .
neighbours of geraldo ramos claim that he was attacked by a dog as he stumbled around the dominican republic naked while drunk .
but mr ramos , of santiago , does n't believe their version of events and is none-the-wiser as to how he came to be dismembered .
mystery illness : geraldo ramos passed out drunk and woke up to find that his penis was missing .
recuperating : mr ramos was pictured relaxing at home recovering from his horrific injury .
he told a local television station that all he remembers is waking up and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery .
the dog which is said to have attacked him has not been traced , nor indeed has mr ramos 's penis .
mr ramos now has to wear a catheter and was filmed recuperating at his home .
he says that he has learned his lesson - mr ramos told noticias sin that he is to lay off the drink from now on .
hurt : mr ramos now has to wear a catheter following the mysterious incident .
no fear : despite mr ramos 's neighbours claiming that he was the victim of a dog attack , the 64-year-old is clearly undeterred from being around canines - he was pictured relaxing with a dog .
while the neighbour 's dog attack tale may seem a little far fetched , it is not entirely unbelievable .
a paralysed man in arkansas woke up in july to find that his dog had eaten one of his testicles .
a brazilian man meanwhile had his toes chewed off by his pet dog .
and it seems it 's not just dog attacks that men should be wary of - a man was rushed to hospital in israel after a snake bit him on the penis while he was going to the toilet .
fortunately the snake was not venomous and the man only suffered minor injuries .
