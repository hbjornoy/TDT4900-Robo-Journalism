at first glance , it appears as it part of the sky is missing .
this amazing image shows a starfield over 700 light years away .
however , part of it is blocked by a massive dust cloud - completely obscuring the telescope 's view .
the dark cloud is called ldn 483 -- for lynds dark nebula 483 , and such clouds are the birthplaces of future stars .
ldn 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of serpens -lrb- the serpent -rrb- .
the cloud contains enough dusty material to completely block the visible light from background stars .
particularly dense molecular clouds , like ldn 483 , qualify as dark nebulae because of this obscuring property .
the starless nature of ldn 483 and its ilk would suggest that they are sites where stars can not take root and grow .
but in fact the opposite is true : dark nebulae offer the most fertile environments for eventual star formation .
` some of the stars appear to be missing in this intriguing new eso image , ' the european space observatory says .
` but the black gap in this glitteringly beautiful starfield is not really a gap , but rather a region of space clogged with gas and dust .

the image was captured using the wide field imager , an instrument mounted on the mpg/eso 2.2-metre telescope at eso 's la silla observatory in chile .

astronomers studying star formation in ldn 483 have discovered some of the youngest observable kinds of baby stars buried in ldn 483 's shrouded interior .
