a sad love story for one man may end up brightening some people 's days this holiday season in south dakota .
the man dropped a 14-karat gold , half-carat diamond engagement ring along with a note in a salvation army kettle outside a sporting goods store in mitchell .
the ring and note were taped to a $ 10 bill .
the note partially reads : ` this ring made me the happiest man in the world when she said yes , and the saddest when she returned it .
' a salvation army store in south dakota received an expensive , albeit heartbreaking , kettle donation this week .
the man added that he hopes the ring can be used ` to make some kids happy ' .
salvation army office manager sheena loudner says the ring has been valued at $ 1,200 .
she says the group is going to try to get some bids on the ring and sell it .
mitchell major vickie cole agreed .
` my heart goes out to that man who gave it , ' mayor cole told keloland tv .
` his heart was broken and a time that could 've been a very joyful time , but then he gave from his heart and said this could help children .
' ` young people , students , families that want to get together and share with their children what this money will help and it 's their way of showing how one hour or two hours will bring a change in someone 's life .
' donations : the ring was collected by these red kettle volunteers in mitchell , south dakota .
surprise : the anonymous donor had wrapped the ring in a $ 10 bill , so the collectors were unaware of who placed it in the bucket .
major cole is hoping to have $ 35,000 from the kettles by the end of the campaign .
however the ringers have only raised about $ 9,000 and there are only two weeks left .
as it stands the highest bid for the engagement ring is $ 750 .
meanwhile , last week an anonymous benefactor placed a separate diamond ring - valued at $ 1,850 - and her wedding band in one of the kettles placed outside boston 's north station .
the rings were accompanied by
