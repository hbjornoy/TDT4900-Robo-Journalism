kell brook got the job done at the weekend and now i think we are about to see britain 's next great world champion .
he is going to get what i believe he deserves -- that title shot .
we were told by the ibf last week that they have ruled on shawn porter , their champion .
with porter fighting paulie malignaggi on april 19 , both men must now sign an agreement with the ibf that the winner will fight brook within 90 days .
before july 19 , i expect him to have his shot and to be a world champion .
dominant : kell brook thrashed alvaro robles at the echo arena in march .
date with destiny : the sheffield boxer is set to earn a long-awaited world title shot .
like i wrote in a previous column , this is a guy who has had nothing but bad luck when it has come to world title shots .
the postponements of his fight with devon alexander devastated him .
i was with him watching alexander 's fight with porter when alexander lost and with it went brook 's scheduled title challenge .
the look on his face .
now he is going to get what he deserves and i promise you it will be special .
this guy has as much talent as any british fighter .
when he is properly motivated he will beat anyone .
the fight against alvaro robles was designed to blow away the cobwebs and break up his camp for the title shot .
now he will go straight back into training .
who will he face ?
it 's a tough one .
you have to say porter is the favourite , but if it 's malignaggi who wins then i think a fight between him and brook is big enough to hold here in the uk .
i am keeping my fingers crossed on that one .
trio : paulie malignaggi -lrb- left -rrb- has fought amir khan -lrb- right -rrb- and ricky hatton and could soon face brook .
frustration : brook had been due to fight american devon alexander for a world title .
tony bellew is one of my favourite fighters .
he has had it hard , but he has as much heart as anyone in the sport .
he won on
