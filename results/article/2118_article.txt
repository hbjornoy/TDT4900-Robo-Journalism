australopithecus sediba is from the same biology family as homo sapiens - humankind - and some experts theorise that the animal eventually evolved into present-day versions of humanity .
the species is thought to have walked the earth around 2million years ago , and could be a crucial step along the evolutionary path to modern man .
the replica skeleton on display - known as ` karabo ' is believed to have belonged to a juvenile male .
an adult male , an adult female and three infant skeletons have also been found .
although the find dates only from 2008 , though it was kept secret by researchers for two years until its existence was announced in 2010 .

lee berger , a paleontologist , was walking with his nine-year-old son matthew at a dig site near johannesburg when he found a buried collarbone .
on further digging , researchers found parts of a skull , teeth and most of the rest of the body of the young skeleton , which stands just over 4ft tall .
the fossilised bones , which are remarkably well-preserved , are thought to have been buried when karabo fell into a deep pit with a soft , sandy bottom which could have buried him .
