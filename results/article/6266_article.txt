one is a toddler who desperately needed an operation to walk , the other an aspiring topless model who wanted a ` boob job ' to look more like jordan .
and there are no prizes for guessing which case the nhs deemed the more urgent .
the health service was yesterday accused of showing a ` skewed sense of priorities ' after it emerged that oliver dockerty , a two-year-old boy with cerebral palsy , has been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk .
priorities : little oliver dockerty , left , was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model josie cunning , right , had her breasts enlarged to 36dd at a cost of # 4,800 to taxpayers .
yet just a few miles away , 22-year-old .
josie cunningham has been given size 36dd breasts at taxpayers ' expense .
because she convinced doctors her flat chest was ` ruining her life ' .
the two cases from leeds have emerged .
after oliver 's mother spoke out about how he has been denied the .
potentially life-changing procedure .
the toddler , who relies on a frame to .
move around , can have the operation only if his single mother claire can .
raise # 25,000 to have it performed privately .
miss dockerty , 30 , said : ` oliver has .
splints on his legs , a flexi-stand as he has n't got any balance , and .
uses a walking frame to get around .
` he wants to be jumping in muddy .
puddles like peppa pig .
he wants to be kicking a football and he ca n't .
jump on a trampoline .
i 'd love to see him walking unaided for his first .
day at primary school .
` i 'm a single parent and i do n't have .
that kind of money .
even if they look again at the decision , there 's .
going to be a big backlog of children like oliver waiting to have this .
done .
' turned down : oliver , who has cerebral palsy , with mother claire , needs a metal frame to walk .
oliver , who lives with his mother in manchester , was referred .
for surgery at leeds general
