most football fans had a punt on the world cup , but jon jolley had more to lose than most .
after betting # 100 on brazil to win for the fifth time - with top striker neymar claiming the golden boot - at 20-1 , the arsenal fan thought he was on to a sure thing .
so much so , jolley , from wrexham , boasted : ` if brazil do n't win the world cup i will climb snowdon in a thong .
' scroll for video below .
long way down : jon jolley climbs snowdon wearing nothing but a thong after losing a football bet .
fast-forward to july 22 - weeks after brazil was mercilessly thrashed 7-1 by germany in the semi-finals - and the 29-year-old kept his promise .
wearing nothing but a welsh thong dragon , jolley made the three-and-a-half-hour steep climb - 3,560 ft above seal level - raising money for cancer research uk .
according to walesonline , it took jolley and and friend leighton cox , the designated cameraman , three-and-half hours to reach the summit of the north wales mountain on tuesday .
video filmed and edited by leighton cox .
' i think i 'm a man of my word , ' joked jon , speaking from the top of the mountain .
' i usually make a bet and keep my mouth shut , but this time the likes of neymar and david luiz let me down big time .
` after sobbing uncontrollably for several hours , i realised i could turn this situation right around .
` by doing the climb for charity i turned this negative into a positive by becoming the first man to climb the mountain in a thong -- i think .
' jolley had initially set out to raise # 150 for charity but has now raised # 450 .
