the 15-piece collection features rompers , jumpsuits and dresses from mini to maxi-length , adorned with french lace , vegan leather , crushed velvet and sequin embellishments .
along with her partner , the style club founder hilary novelle , sophie worked with a set of upcoming trends and then found a way to make them look good on her body .
her first collection with the style club , which launched in fall and sold out in a mere 72 hours , was built in much the same way .
` all the waistbands are elastic , which i prefer , ' she told mailonline in october .
` essentially , the collection is based around my butt .
