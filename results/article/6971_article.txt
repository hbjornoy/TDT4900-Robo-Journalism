a brace from arsenal 's new signing danny welbeck not only restored the team 's confidence , but also recaptured the nation 's interest after last week 's dull international friendly against norway .

back in favour : england 's victory against switzerland saw viewers tune in to watch the game again .
resolve : england fans have started to recover from the hangover of a dreadful world cup in brazil .
the reasons for the downfall in interest , which also saw only around 40,000 spectators travel to wembley , was blamed on england 's dismal performance at the world cup where roy hodgson 's side were eliminated after only two games .
however , the figures for the more meaningful fixture shown on itv on monday rose to an average of 5.6 m - beating the 4.9 million who watched the bbc series new tricks .
whether games against england 's remaining group e opponents , which include lithuania , estonia , slovenia and san marino , can retain fans ' interest remains to be seen .
