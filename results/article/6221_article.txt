the girlfriend of a rapist who tried to clear his name by framing two of his victims with false facebook profiles has been jailed .
ceri shipman , 25 , wrote fake confessions that the sex attacks had been made up in in a desperate attempt to get her partner jason savage , 29 , out of prison .
one of the bogus messages said : ` maybe we did lie , but there 's nothing you can do about it ' .
after police were alerted , the rape victims were arrested and questioned by detectives before police uncovered the sick plot in hull , east yorkshire .
savage , a former boxer , was found guilty of three counts of rape and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm against two of his victims .
he may never be released from prison after receiving a life sentence with a minimum term of nine years in april 2010 .
shipman thought the sentence handed down to her boyfriend was unfair and was convinced the victims were lying , so set her plan in motion , hull crown court heard yesterday .
after shipman created the false profile for the first victim , shipman sent a message to herself reading : ` you want to know about .
your loser boyfriend yet ?
' she replied from her own profile : ' i have nothing to say to you .
i added you by accident .
' the ` victim ' said : ` maybe i did make up the rape , but he broke my heart .
' shipman then remarked : ` it is women like you who need to be locked up .
' after creating the false facebook confessions , shipman handed her dossier of ` evidence ' over to police who arrested the victims .
they were questioned for a total of 13 hours and bailed for four months .
however , police and it experts were able to trace the location the messages were sent
