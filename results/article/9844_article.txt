a minnesota gnraphic designer who made fun of the nsa has found himself in a legal battle with the agency which is trying to ban his creation .
drawing inspiration from the revelations made this year by edward snowden , dan mccall , 38 , of sauk rapids , created a humorous t-shirt poking fun at the agency 's domestic spying programs , causing the spooks to send him a cease and desist letter .
` when i got finished i thought , this is pretty good -- i thought it was fun , ' the nsa disagreed , forcing the shirts off the market -- now mr mccall is fighting back , according to wcco .
` peeping while you 're sleeping ' : this t-shirt drew the ire of nsa lawyers , who called it copyright infringement .

he then put the phrase ` the only part of government that actually listens ' directly under the parodied seal and started making t-shirts .
the spy agency soon caught wind of the shirts and brought an end to the fun .
calling it a violation of their intellectual property rights , the nsa 's cease and desist letter ordered him to immediately stop selling the shirts .
it 's a classic parody : dan mccall , the graphic artist behind the shirt , says he is parodying the government - which is protected under the first amendment .
can you hear me now ?
: spooks are n't fond of mr mccall 's spoofing of their spying .
fighting bacl : mr mccall is suing the spy agency for infringing on his right to freedom of speech .
mr mccall disagrees .
` because when you 're pointing straight at an organization or making fun at it , turning it on itself , that is classic parody , ' he told told the station .
saying that he does n't want his children to grow up in a country where you ca n't
