ap mccoy stood with the trainer , jonjo o'neill , in the parade ring .
he tried to talk but his mind was elsewhere .
he was waiting for the end to come .
at 4.15 pm a bell rang out .
mccoy did not need to be reminded for whom it tolled .
he knew it tolled for him .
he obeyed the signal for the jockeys to mount .
he walked alongside box office , the final ride of his astonishing career , and then clambered into the saddle .
the tears streamed down his face but he pulled down his goggles so that nobody would see .
he rode out on to the course .
mccoy was presented the champion jockey trophy by ian wright - mccoy is an arsenal fanatic .
the 40-year-old received a guard of honour before receiving the champion jockey trophy .
he knew this would be a strange day .
he was aware it was being styled as a joyous celebration of the career of the greatest jump jockey there has ever been .
` the champ , the finale ' it said on the front of sandown park 's raceday programme .
but mccoy knew , too , that , for him , the day of his retirement would be a day filled with sadness and dread .
earlier in the afternoon , he had ridden mr mole into third place in the bet365 ap mccoy celebration chase .
now , he had one last shot at giving sandown 's biggest crowd for a decade what they wanted by riding a winner .
so one last time , he rode a mount around the surrey track , racing the rest of the field and one of the red-and-blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course , towards waterloo .
a film script would have delivered his 4,358 th winner but sport is more capricious than celluloid .
and so it delivered an irony .
the last race of mccoy 's career , the bet365 handicap hurdle , was won by richard johnson , 15 times a runner-up to mccoy in the jockeys ' championship .
the two men are great friends but this was one small act of revenge for 20 years of being a bridesmaid .
mccoy , 40 , finished third
