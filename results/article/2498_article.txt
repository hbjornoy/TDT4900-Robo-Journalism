brave : stephen has terminal cancer .
there ca n't be many people who have n't heard about stephen sutton .
i doubt it was ever his intention , but his handsome , young face , giving the thumbs up from his hospital bed , bidding the world a cheery farewell as he faced up to terminal cancer , has made him a global superstar .
