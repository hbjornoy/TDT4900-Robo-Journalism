bonus : stephen hester , ceo of the royal bank of scotland .
david cameron has stepped in to halve the bonus of the royal bank of scotland chief-executive in a pay crackdown .
but stephen hester is still set to pocket a # 750,000 payout today at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer .
whitehall sources believe mr hester may .
see the maximum bonus he is entitled to of # 1.5 million cut in half to .
# 750,000 in order to show that the coalition is reining in executive .
pay .
asked recently if the government will use .
its shareholding to keep mr hester 's bonus under # 1 million , the prime .
minister said : ` the short answer is yes .

government officials will send a ` strong message ' to the committee that mr hester 's pay must be cut .
but even a # 750,000 payment is set to spark fury at the failure of ministers to strip the chief-executive of a bonus altogether in a year when rbs has seen its share price collapse by 40 per cent .
the fear is that the well regarded mr hester will quit rbs if he is refused a bonus - and ministers believe he is doing a good job .
speaking in brighton last night , sir mervyn said the bonus bonanza comes at a time when ordinary workers are suffering ` a ferocious squeeze ' on their take-home pay .
he said soaring inflation has led to ` the longest period over which real wages have failed to rise since the 1920s ' .
sir mervyn said : ` the tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it .
' he added it would be wrong ` if rewards .
go disproportionately to a small elite , especially one which benefited .
from the support of taxpayers .
' there .
is intense pressure
