its chimes counting down to each new year are famous the world over .
now big ben will mark the date in another way -- by appearing on a limited edition # 100 coin .
the coin , of which only 50,000 will be made , was unveiled by the royal mint yesterday and is britain 's first # 100 coin .
it is also the first time the royal mint has brought out a coin specifically for new year .
the uk 's first # 100 coins are pressed by liam oram at the royal mint at llantrisant , in wales .
the coin , which is 40mm wide and contains 2oz of silver , is expected to prove popular in britain .
big ben is pictured from street level to show it at its most familiar angle to visitors in the special coin .
the coins build on the ` british fever ' following the olympics in 2012 and the birth of prince george .

the iconic clock tower of the houses of parliament in london -- officially called the elizabeth tower , with big ben the nickname for the bell inside -- is pictured from street level to show it at its most familiar angle to visitors .
and like regular coins , it features the queen 's head on the other side .
shane bissett , the royal mint 's director of commemorative coin , bullion and medals , said : ` the sound of big ben chiming in the elizabeth tower is one that will have become synonymous with britain for millions of british citizens and tourists alike , particularly on new year 's eve when the world listens for big ben , which marks greenwich mean time , to chime in the new year .
` so it is a fitting choice for the nation 's first # 100 coin , and this is a fitting time for us to reveal it .
' the coin , which is 40mm -lrb- 1.6 in -rrb- wide and contains 2oz of silver , is expected to prove popular after the sell-out success of the first # 20 coin , which was struck in honour of the birth of prince george .
