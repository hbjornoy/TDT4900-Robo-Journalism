never mind two peas in a pod , these apples are quite literally joined at the hip .
the unusual fruit consists of two apples that have latched on to one another from the side and grown together - creating a quirky mirror-image fruit .
from the bottom , a bridge-like structure can be seen - which appears to be joining the two together .
odd : a homeowner found this strange conjoined fruit in his back garden .
joined : the two fruits appear to be joined by a strange bridge like piece of apple flesh .
the fruit shares a single stalk , but has two cores and two sets of pips .
homeowner ned sparham certainly got two for the price of one when he discovered the bizarre conjoined apple in his garden .
the keen gardener discovered the fruit .
lying metres from an apple tree near to his home .
in bromley , south east london .
mr sparham said : ` i 'd been away on holiday and when i got back i found it -lsb- the apple -rsb- lying on the ground beneath the tree .
conjoined : the fruit has one stalk , but two cores and two sets of pips .
' i could n't believe my eyes .
in all the years i 've lived here i 've never seen such a strange looking apple .
when i spotted it , it was a real case of cor blimey !
' mr sparham decided the best thing to do with his conjoined find was to make a giant apple pie .
the gardener 's find was not a first , however .
in 2010 , another siamese apple - with one fruit sprouting from the top of the other - was found in slovakia by a farmer .
good use : the homeowner who found the fruit , ned sparham , made an apple pie with his quirky discovery .
