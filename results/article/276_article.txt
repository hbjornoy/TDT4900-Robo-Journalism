a 19-year-old 's routine eye test ended up saving her life after optician 's found a tumour the size of an egg attached to her retina was pushing against her brain .
student alice walker , from allestree , derby , was taken by her father to optician , phillip bradley , for a regular check-up after battling nausea and severe headaches for months .
after specialists had studied her retina , the light-sensitive nerve layer at the back of her eye , they were stunned at their discovery .
a routine eye test carried out at her local opticians showed that one of alice 's retinas was completely swollen and the ` wrong shape ' because of a tumour .
the back of alice 's eye was completely swollen and the ` wrong shape ' which led them to discover a potentially fatal brain tumour last october .
within hours , she was in the royal derby hospital , where she was diagnosed with a rare type of tumour which had grown to the size of a small egg and had been pressing on her brain .
alice said : ` i 'd been feeling ill for about six months and had been to the doctors about four or five times .
' i had an eye test in april and everything was normal .
but when my dad took me back in october , it was a very different story - we know something was wrong and i was told my retina was swollen .
` instead of it being concave it was convex and my central vision had become poor .
' i was told that i would be referred .
the next day , i was in hospital .
' alice , who had felt ill with headaches and nausea for six months before her diagnosis , underwent a four-hour operation to remove 98 per cent of the tumour , which could have become life-threatening if left untreated .
in less than a week , alice was undergoing brain surgery ,
