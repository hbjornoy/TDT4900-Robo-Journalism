a mother from scotland has vented her frustration after council workers refused to collect her bin because it was left open one inch .
the binmen , from midlothian council , said that new health and safety rules meant they could n't collect the waste , claiming the bag had become jammed .
susan wright , 39 , from dalkeith , owns the bin and has called the decision ` bonkers ' .
susan wright , 39 , a mother-of-three from dalkeith has hit out at midlothian council after workers refused to empty her bin which had a bag caught in the lid .
the mother-of-three said : ` surely there 's common sense that tells you that you can lift a bin lid up to see if the bin is overflowing or not , or whether a bag 's just caught .
` they did n't even bother to do that .
they go on about health and safety of their workers , but what about the health and safety of my family ?
` we 're a family of five , i 've got a young baby and i 've now got to store a month 's worth of bin rubbish .
' however when she complained officials told her she would have to wait a fortnight for the binmen to come back , as workers are being told not to empty any bin which is left open , whether it is overflowing or not .
in a statement , the council said : ` as you know , due to health and safety regulations , the binmen are now not emptying bins where the lid is open .
this is a procedure that they are following very strictly .
` it is unlikely that the men will call back to empty your bin .
i understand that in this case it was not due to the bin overflowing .
i have therefore passed your concerns onto the waste management team for information .
