the newsreader had another on-air gaffe last december when she went live to air before she was ready .
she was sprung reading over her notes and teasing her off-screen colleagues , saying : ` you would just insert your opinions .
' but when she realised the comment had gone to air she looked shocked , before quickly getting back to the news .
