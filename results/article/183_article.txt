thug : christopher towers , 25 , outside prison enjoying his freedom at the weekend barely a year after he was jailed for three and a half years .
a young mother left paralysed by a drunken thug only discovered her attacker had been let out of prison early when she saw gloating photos on facebook .
claire hilton was sickened to find pictures of christopher towers having fun after serving only a third of his sentence for breaking her neck .
the snaps are thought to have been posted by his girlfriend , who wrote underneath , ` finally with my boy ' .
the case made headlines in november 2011 when towers was granted bail ahead of sentencing which allowed him to spend christmas with his family .
miss hilton yelled at him during the hearing : ` look what you 've done .
you 've ruined my life .
' towers , 25 , was jailed for three and a half years in january last year for punching miss hilton , in the face after a row over a spilt drink .
just 15 months after he was put behind bars , he is out on weekend licence , allowing him to spend time with girlfriend kelly mckone .
after miss hilton , 30 , came across the picture of him earlier this month , she contacted the police who told her he was due to be released imminently and that as part of his preparation he would be spending a weekend on the outside every 28 days .
miss hilton said : ` when i saw the picture i felt sick to my stomach .
' i could n't believe that no-one from the police or probation had warned me .
' miss hilton , from sunderland , had been on a night out with friends at the wheatsheaf pub in boldon when trouble flared over a drink that had been knocked over on towers 's mother , lynn flaherty , 47 .
the friends offered to buy her another drink but she and her son flew into a rage .
they were ordered out of the pub but waited outside until miss hilton and her friends left .
