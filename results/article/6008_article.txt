whether it 's his real name or not , only a man called joe gross could possibly upload this video .
definitely not for the squeamish , it shows mr ` gross ' removing what is quite possibly the world 's longest ingrown hair .
the video begins with ` gross ' claiming , maybe not for the first time , that this is the grossest thing he 's ever done .
joe gross lines up the clump of ingrown hair on his neck with his tweezers .
after clamping the tweezers around the clump of hair he gives it a good tug .
` i 've had this giant black mark on my face for months and it literally looks like a pound of hair , ' he said .
then , using a pair of pink tweezers to make the whole procedure a little more stylish , he starts pulling the clump of black hair from his cheek .
what goes on from here is pretty hard to stomach as gross goes on to live up to his name and gets to work on removing the hair .
there must be a lot of horror fans out there in cyberspace as the video has gone viral .
during the disgusting drama gross describes how he had a pimple which would ooze every couple of months for about a year .
the hair comes out slowly in long strands that seem to take ages to come out .
he finally pulls the last piece of hair out using the tweezers leaving only a hole and specks of blood .
a dermatologist made it clear to him that it was a cyst that would need to cut out , but as the hair just kept on being pulled out it ended up being just ` the longest ingrown hair in history .
' equally revolting was the moment a canadian man last month squeezed a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years , and a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades was released .
but ` joe gross ' has grossed out everyone for now .
