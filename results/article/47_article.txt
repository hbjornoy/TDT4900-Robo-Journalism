when a premier league club signs a global superstar , they often tweet a picture of the new arrival putting pen to paper on the deal .
but things are a little different in league two , where cheltenham town attempted to unveil their loan signing eusebio bancessi .
bancessi , an arrival from wolves , was pictured supposedly signing his new contract on friday - but cheltenham forgot to provide the contract .
eusebio bancessi puts pen to table as he joins cheltenham town on loan from wolves for a month .
bancessi has not yet played a first team game for wolves since arriving from benfica in 2013 .
instead the player was left with a pen in his hand , as if he were about to sign the desk to seal the deal .
bancessi joined wolves from benfica in 2013 but has not started a first-team game for the midlands club .
the 19-year-old portuguese forward will join cheltenham with a month , although the deal could be extended .
wolves responded by claiming the portuguese striker only ever puts his signature on tables .
the young striker is quick and powerful and could make a big impact during his short stay in cheltenham .
