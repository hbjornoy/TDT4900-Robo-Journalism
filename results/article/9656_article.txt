racist : john hennigan , 46 , of harlow , essex , was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in front of shocked drinkers in february at the magpie pub in bishopsgate , central london .
hennigan claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink , but was convicted by a majority verdict of 10-2 after a trial at the old bailey in central london .
sentencing hennigan , judge nicholas cooke qc told him the court was ` not upholding some culture of political correctness ' but ` preserving public order ' and dealing with unacceptable behavior .
he added : ` in this crowded public house in this city you gave a nazi salute and spoke provocatively of jews .
the holocaust was a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude .
` behaving in the way you did was appalling .
you spoke of black people as c *** s and n ***** s. ` the use of such terms is grossly offensive and conjures up memories of the slave trade , again a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude .
behaving in such a way was likewise appalling .
' the judge said hennigan 's antics were also an affront to those who fought against the ` racist evil of nazism ' in the second world war and ` insults the memories of those who sacrificed themselves ' .
