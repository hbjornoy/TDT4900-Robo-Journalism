34-year-old lisa guit was horrified to be advised by a doctor that she would not get the treatment she needed on the nhs because it is a ` shambles ' when lisa guit was diagnosed with cervical cancer while working as a banker in singapore , she flew home to britain to receive the best care the nhs could provide .
but , on arriving home , the 34-year-old was horrified to be told by her doctor that the health service was in a ` shambles ' , she would ` probably die on the waiting list ' -- and would be better off going back to singapore to get treatment there .
she eventually did just that but now , five years after successful treatment overseas , remains ` disgusted ' by what she was told .
she said : ` he clearly had zero sympathy for the situation i was in .
he may have been telling the truth but he was so callous about it , he took away any hope i had .
` instead of offering treatment and talking about my options he said , `` the nhs is a shambles .
you 'll probably die on the waiting list .
'' i was in absolute shock .
' ` it is not the kind of thing someone with such a low chance of survival expects to hear .
' miss guit , from kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire , was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008 , shortly after arriving in singapore , and initially began treatment there .
but when doctors began to operate they discovered the cancer had spread , and removed 14 lymph nodes from her groin and legs , as well as her ovaries .
the fact the cancer had spread meant miss guit 's survival rate had dropped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent .
she was told the treatment she would require next would be extremely expensive and was advised to come back home .
she said : ` i knew straight away i could n't afford it .
i paid a lot of national insurance tax so expected a high level of care on the nhs .
