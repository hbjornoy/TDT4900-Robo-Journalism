murray is seeded no 8 at flushing meadows - his lowest grand slam seeding for more than six years - after failing to win a title since his wimbledon triumph in july 2013 .
the 27-year-old has found it difficult to rediscover his best form consistently since undergoing back surgery last september and was hit hard by his split with coach ivan lendl in march .

tough going : andy murray has struggled to rediscover his best form since undergoing back surgery .
mcenroe , who will compete in december 's statoil masters tennis event at london 's royal albert hall , said : ` it 's difficult to say what 's happening with andy .
` it seems like the physical issues are behind him - it 's impossible to say for sure from the outside but that 's how it looks .
` it 's been a process for him to come back from those issues so that takes its toll on the confidence , and he made a big change - i thought he and ivan worked well together .
' ` to change course when he did is tricky so it remains to be seen what happens there .
you need to give it more time to judge , but you sort of feel like the us open would be a time he needs to step up because it 's been a struggle compared to what it 's been the last couple of years .
