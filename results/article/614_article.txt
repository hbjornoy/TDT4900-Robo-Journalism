zookeepers have welcomed a new lion cub - but not the tricky task of weighing her .
karis is the second lion cub to be born at blair drummond safari park near stirling and handlers had to use a sack to get her on the scales .
weighing in at 5kg , the cub will stay with her mother until she is 12 weeks old before they are returned to the pride .
weight-in : the lion cub registered a healthy 5kg when she was dropped into a sack and popped on the scales .
two pairs of hands : mr reid is given a hand to balance karis , who is putting up a bit of a fight , on the scales .
stuggle : the lioness cub registered a healthy 5kg , but had to be wrestled into a sack for her weigh-in .
hiss : there is no doubting karis ' fierce creature credentials as she snarls at the photographer .
park manager gary gilmour said : ` even though she is a wee cutie , keepers had to use a hessian sack to help with the weigh-in , as even at five weeks old she is a real handful and can still give a nasty scratch .

mr reid said : ` teekay and karis have been bonding in the .
house next door to the main pride , so everyone knows there is a new kid .

before we mix her with the rest of pride .
