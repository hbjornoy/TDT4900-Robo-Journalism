victor valdes has travelled to monaco in a bid to prove his fitness ahead of a free transfer after barcelona released the goalkeeper at the end of last season .
the 32-year-old is currently out with a serious knee injury that will almost certainly keep him out for months .
but the big-spending ligue 1 side are keen to measure the extent of the problem and whether valdes is still a viable long-term option .
almost there : victor valdes was pictured with a monaco supporter in the principality on wednesday .
it 's all over : the goalkeeper ended a 19-year association with barcelona at the end of last season .
leonardo jardim - appointed after the sacking of claudio ranieri - will lead monaco into the champions league next season .
the former sporting lisbon coach appeared to have abandoned plans to sign the spain international , even though the club had agreed a pre-contract agreement back in january .
valdes ended a 19-year association with the catalan giants after they decided not to renew his deal at the nou camp .
there is a belief that he still has a lot to offer and represents something of a coup for jardim .
croatian danijel subasic was the no 1 at stade louis ii last season and would remain so until valdes ' knee healed fully .
one supporter tweeted a picture with the potential new goalkeeper in the principality on wednesday evening .
he 's out of there !
ranieri was sacked by monaco despite achieving champions league qualification .
