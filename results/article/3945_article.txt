dalton henry , 15 , was severely burned while helping his older cousin burn brush when a gas can exploded .
' i just prayed to god that it would n't be bad .
and it was , ' she said .
' i wish he would have just listened and not picked up that gas can , ' she continued .
` it 's a very , very hard lesson for him , a very hard lesson .
' after he was injured in february , doctors told the family his road to recovery would be long and arduous .
the family has since set up a gofundme to help offset medical costs .
while progress is slow , his family said it is still miraculous .
` sometimes they say two weeks , three weeks and it turns into months , ' carrie said .
and with several surgeries still ahead , the process has taken its toll on the family .
' i do my best not to cry every time i look at him , ' she says .
` it just about kills me that he got burnt that bad .
' she 's quit her job so she can take care of dalton full-time , and says she now knows her son is a fighter .
' i said you fought .
you fought hard , ' she says .
` you know , you 're a strong boy .
never once did he cry .
' as he heals , he 's been able to go fishing and even swim this summer .
` he 'll never be 100 % back where he was , no .
but even if it 's halfway .
or 75 % back , that would be just awesome , ' carrie says .
and while most of the procedures have gone well
