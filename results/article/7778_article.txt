it 's one of london 's most desirable addresses with five-star hotels and fabulous views over hyde park .
but the romanian travellers who have descended on park lane are not the most welcome of visitors .
suitcases in tow , they have taken over a patch of grass near marble arch and it is feared they may set up a camp .
back on the scene : romanian beggars have been pictured setting up camp in marble arch once again .
going nowhere : the group was pictured huddle together chatting or sleeping on the grass nearby .
nuisance : others were pictures gathered in the doorway of a luggage shop drinking cups of tea .
a 40-strong band did exactly that a year ago , turning the site into a rubbish dump and being accused of knife-point robberies and other crimes .
yesterday richard owen , who has a burger van at marble arch , said the new arrivals were bad for tourism .
he said he had just seen two romanian women ` pull their skirts down , squat down and go to the toilet ' .
he added : ` there were tourists going by on those open-top buses , people everywhere , they did n't care .
it was absolutely disgusting .
` the police do n't seem to be doing anything .
` all they seem to be doing is going up and checking passports and then just let them go .
taking a nap : it is not yet clear if these travellers are part of the same gang who blighted marble arch last year .
problem : police and westminster council faced a long-running battle to remove the travellers last summer .
blight : the beggars have gathered in sight of some of the capital 's top hotels .
` when i get here in the morning there are usually about 60-70 of them .
they are drinking and begging .
it 's ruining the tourism .
' tony carlozzi , 31 , on holiday with a friend from new york , said she saw one of the group urinating in the underpass .
` he just looked at me , he was drunk ,
