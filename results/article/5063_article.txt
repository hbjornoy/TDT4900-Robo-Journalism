england coach peter moores has urged alastair cook to ` stay strong ' as he tries to bat his way out of the worst drought of his 105-test career .
cook 's latest attempt to register an increasingly elusive 26th century will begin on thursday at lord 's , where england take on india in the second investec test following the bore draw at trent bridge .
