a ` jealous ' husband who stabbed his ` flirtatious ' bride to death threatened to kill her a month before , a court heard .

nazar is alleged to have been jealous , controlling and possessive - and resentful of his ` flirtatious and attractive ' wife having ` many boyfriends ' .
on the night ms younis died she had met a previous partner for a lovers ' tryst .
the prosecution in nazar 's murder trial in manchester say he believed by marrying her he could secure his stay in britain .
ms younis , 30 , who was known as ` jabeen ' , was found stabbed to death at her home at bamford street , chadderton on april 19 after her young son from a previous relationship called 999 .
nazar has admitted manslaughter , but denies murder , saying he was mentally ill at the time .
carla cutting , a friend of ms younis , told the court in a statement she learnt nazar had killed her from an overheard conversation , three days after it happened .
` jabeen was always talking about -lrb- nazar -rrb- and showing pictures of him .
she was very proud of him and at first seemed head over heels - but their relationship was very stormy .
she was talking about splitting up with him but then they would be back together ' , ms cutting said .
` the last time i spoke to jabeen was on facebook two days before her death .
she said she could not talk because ` you know who ' -lrb- nazar -rrb- was present .
i can remember one occasion about a month before jabeen 's death , when i was present when she was speaking to nazar on her mobile phone .
