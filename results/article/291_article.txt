a recently discovered asteroid gave earth a close shave yesterday as it came within the moon 's orbit .
the near-earth asteroid 2012 xe54 , which was only spotted for the first time on sunday , came within 140,000 miles of our planet .
the moon orbits at an average distance of 240,000 miles or so from the earth .
astronomers estimate that 2012 xe54 is about 120ft wide - big enough to cause substantial damage if it ever hits us .

asteroids eclipsing during an earth flyby are relatively rare , with the first known case of asteroid 2008 tc3 which was totally eclipsed just one hour before entering earth 's atmosphere over sudan in 2008 , and asteroid 2012 kt42 experiencing both an eclipse and a transit during the same earth flyby in 2012 .
