the version contains the line : ` he 's been tanning n ****** out in timbuktu , now he 's coming back to do the same to you .
' following .
the broadcast , mr lowe immediately offered to apologise on air for his .
error - but the corporation ordered mr lowe to ` fall on his sword ' after .
just one listener complained .
according to the mirror , the 68-year-old told the jon gaunt show on fubar radio : ` when talking about my treatment , i prefer to use the word ` inconsistencies ' , rather than ` double-standards ' , because to the best of my knowledge , the version of the song i played was , certainly until just a few days ago , on the bbc 's ` okay to play ' list .
` and one of my all-time favourites , oliver 's army by elvis costello , which features the n-word , is still played regularly on british radio .
' mr lowe has said the show was .
pre-recorded - but it not approved for transmission by station managers .
as required by the bbc 's compliance system .
he added that the bbc management structure was ` flawed ' and should be ` scrapped ' .
mr lowe said : ' i do n't have any quarrels with my bbc colleagues - my quarrel is with the flawed system they are trying to work with .
` the bbc is trying to be all things to all men and women - and that 's an impossibility in anyone 's language .
