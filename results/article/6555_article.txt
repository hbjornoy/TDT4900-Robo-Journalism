this is the hilarious moment a curious pufferfish managed to not only photobomb an unsuspecting diver - it took over his selfie-session altogether .
underwater photographer regan mizuguchi was busy taking pictures of himself off the kohala coast in hawaii when the fish swam into shot and decided it wanted to be famous .
the frightened fish managed to completely eclipse the face of mr mizuguchi after inflating its body as a defence mechanism .
caught on camera : regan mizuguchi was taking selfies and had no idea the pufferfish had photobombed him .
sneaking into frame : mr mizuguchi said he noticed the fish , but because it was inflated he kept a safe distance away in order not to scare it .
luckily , the sharp spines were a safe distance away from the hawaiian , and after realising he was n't a threat the fish deflated and swam away .
mr mizuguchi said he had noticed the fish while experimenting with his gopro camera , but because it was inflated ' i did n't want scare the little fish anymore than it was , so i stayed still and carried on taking photos ' .
he was unaware he 'd captured the marine animals mugshot until he exited the water and checked his camera .
mr mizuguchi said : ` it was only after i reviewed the images that i noticed it had completely blocked out my face in one of the shots , i could n't believe how perfect it was .
` i 'm really glad the fish decided to photo bomb me , that photograph is definitely a keeper .
