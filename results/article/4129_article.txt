william warmisham told the gold coast bulletin that he ` should have pleaded not bloody guilty ' after being sentenced at the southport district court in brisbane on friday .
the court heard that the incident occurred at the car park of the surfers paradise tavern beer garden , where a fight began between the group mr warmisham was with and a number of other patrons in september of 2011 .
and while on bail for that offence the man incredibly tried to run down his former lover and her now boyfriend .
a 64 year old man was sentenced to a year in jail on friday after pleading guilty to striking a woman with his walking stick and breaking her jaw .
the 34-year-old woman ran towards the group in the hope of stopping the fight which had just broken out , when the 64-year-old unexpectedly lashed out at her .
it was at this point that the crown prosecutor , nicholas mcghee , said the accused struck her head with his walking stick .
the woman was badly injured from the blow , requiring surgery for her fractured jaw .
despite pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm , mr warmisham claimed he acted in self defence .
during his sentencing however , judge brian devereaux rebutted his claims , stating that the woman had not been involved in the earlier dispute and was clearly attempting to prevent any further violence .
mr warmisham 's one-year sentence is an addition to his previously acquired sentence of two years .
while on bail for assaulting the 34-year-old woman , he was sentenced to two years in prison for intentionally driving his car at his previous partner and her boyfriend .
warmisham will be released on parole on september 19 .
