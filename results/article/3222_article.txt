if you spotted this chap wandering in john lewis , you might think he was lost .
or just passing through on his way to the barber 's .
but you 'd be mistaken .
this rather unkempt young fellow is the new face of the john lewis men 's clothing range .
not that you can see much of his face -- thanks to the bushy beard and unbelievably messy mane of tumbling hair .
the brooding backpacker look : john lewis 's new model sports a bushy beard and tumbling , long hair .
how this type of john lewis man fits .
with the store 's reputation for middle-class respectability and .
tradition is yet to be explained .
but eyebrows are sure to be raised when customers spot him on the store 's website .
according to matthew mccormack , john lewis 's buying director , this new look ` represents what the brand is about ' .
he added : ` he is a little deconstructed but kind of smart and has a great sense of style .
` he is a bit dishevelled and is deliberately growing his hair , but he cares about his look .
` he is a hard-working , everyday-hero kind of bloke .
' the hairy model in question is johnny harrington , 32 , a former carpenter from milton keynes .
the company specifically asked for a model with a beard for the new menswear range .
buying director says new face ` represents what the brand is about ' and is an ` everyday hero ' the store specifically asked for a model with a beard to show off its john lewis & co men 's label .
mr harrington , who looks as if he 's just stepped out of a backpacker 's hostel and is said to have been growing his beard for three years , apparently fit the bill perfectly .
more traditionally clean-cut models are to be kept to promote the store 's other clothing lines .
a spokesman said : ` these particular images are different to what we have usually , but they have n't alienated our customers and have attracted new ones .
