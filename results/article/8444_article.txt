end of an era : peter parker 's life takes a wild turn in the pages of amazing spider-man no. 700 .
after 50 years of spinning webs and catching a who 's who of criminals , peter parker is out of the hero game .
but spider-man is still slinging from building to building - reborn , refreshed and revived with a new sense of the old maxim that ben parker taught his then-fledgling nephew that ` with great power , comes great responsibility .
' writer dan slott , who 's been penning spidey adventures for the better part of the last 100 issues for marvel entertainment , said the culmination of the story is a new , dramatically different direction for the hero that steve ditko and stan lee created in 1962 .
` this is an epic turn , ' slott said .
` i 've been writing spider-man for 70-plus issues .
every now and then , you have to shake it up ... the reason spider-man is one of the longest running characters is they always find a way to keep it fresh .
something to shake up the mix .
' and in the pages of issue 700 , which came out yesterday , it 's not just shaken up , it 's turned head over heels , spun in circles , kicked sky high and cracked wide open .
parker 's mind is trapped in the withered , decaying dying body of his nemesis , doctor octopus aka otto octavius .
where 's doc ock ?
inside parker 's super-powered shell , learning what life is like for the brilliant researcher who happens to count the avengers and fantastic four as friends and family .
the two clash mightily in the pages of issue 700 , illustrated by humberto ramos and victor olazaba .
but it 's octavius who wins out and parker is , at least for now , gone for good , but not before one more act of heroism .
slott said that it 's parker , whose memories envelop octavius , who shows the villain what it means to be a hero .
twist : in amazing spider-man no. 700 ,
