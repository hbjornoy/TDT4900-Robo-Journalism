a fist-pumping run down the line , a win and a red card .
life is rarely dull for neil lennon and his start to life as a manager in england was no different .
he waited six months for this chance , first eyeing a position in the premier league and then , in time , cardiff and fulham .
some of his calls were ignored , a few were answered .
ultimately , no-one seemed to want a man who led celtic to a win over barcelona .
so here is at bolton .
they were bottom of the championship going into this one ; they finished it with only their second win of the season .
bolton defender matt mills -lrb- centre -rrb- scored the only goal of the match heading home on 20 minutes .
mills -lrb- right -rrb- is congratulated by his team-mates for his goal which moves the trotters off bottom spot .
mills -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his strike with neil lennon -lrb- centre -rrb- as he scores the first goal of his reign as bolton boss .

he demonstrated his energy for management with a mourinho-style dance down the line when matt mills headed bolton in front .
he stayed standing in his tracksuit when the heavens opened in the second half , eyes bulging and yelling instructions .
he ended in the stands after the dust settled from bolton 's late penalty
