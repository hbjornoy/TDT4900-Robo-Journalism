jonny wilkinson could lend his expertise to england 's world cup bid as he makes the first moves in his coaching career .
the 35-year-old former fly-half , who retired during the summer after a glittering 17-year career , has been invited to cast an eye over stuart lancaster 's squad as they prepare for next year 's tournament on home soil .
wilkinson , who is currently coaching for one week a month at former club toulon , insists that just because he could play the game , it does not necessarily mean he can tell others how to do so , but he admits he may take up the invitation .

speaking at newcastle racecourse at an event to recruit world cup volunteers , the england rugby 2015 ambassador said : ' i have spoken to the guys a bit , just because they were saying feel free to come along and have a little chat and see what you think and if there 's anything you can add .
' i have got plenty of time - and i need plenty of time - to understand where i go next .
i 'd love to go down there and see what they 're doing because whatever they are doing is very , very good .
' i may pop down there and spend a little time at pennyhill on the sidelines and watch the guys doing what they are doing and enjoy that .
' wilkinson 's coaching aspirations are currently no more extensive than his role at toulon , and thoughts of greater involvement are far from his mind .
he said : ` at the moment , it 's great to know the guys i am working with , and i can grab them .
i know them already from playing with them and i can say , ` look , let 's work on this ' .
i know what they need and i know their personalities , so i am already a step ahead .
` but it 's a tough world and the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that just because you played the game , you know what you are doing .
