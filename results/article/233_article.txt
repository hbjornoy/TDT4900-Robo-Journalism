the european tour season finished in dubai on sunday , but it appears the hard work may have just begun for rory mcilroy and justin rose .
before the pair begun competing in the season-finale world tour championship , race to dubai winner and world no 1 mcilroy uploaded an image of him lifting a huge weight .
it did not bypass the attention of his fellow ryder cup and previous us open winner justin rose , who felt inspired by his good friend off the course to get down the gym himself , albeit with a slight difference .
video scroll down to watch rory mcilroy crowned winner of the race to dubai .
justin rose -lrb- top -rrb- mocked rory mcilroy 's -lrb- bottom -rrb- picture of him lifting a huge weight via instagram .
mcilroy poses with the race to dubai trophy at the end of the world tour championship in dubai .
rose was tied second for the tournament on 14-under , as was mcilroy , two behind winner henrik stenson .
rose 's post , where he jokingly challenged mcilroy to beat what he was lifting , did not distract either from finishing their seasons in style in abu dhabi .
both players finished tied second , two shots behind winner henrik stenson , another member of the victorious ryder cup team at gleneagles .
but mcilroy collected the enourmous race to dubai trophy at the end of the tournament , and would have needed all the strength gained from his intense workouts as he held it for the cameras .
