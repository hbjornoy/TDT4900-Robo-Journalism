newlyweds : andrew and neely moldovan , pictured on their wedding day , have not yet received their professionally taken photos because the photographer claims they owe her an extra $ 150 .
incredulous : the couple , who live in dallas , texas , say the extra fee is for a cover for their photo album - but the cost was never outlined in their contract with the photographer .
the extra fee is $ 150 - and if they do n't pay it , they will be unable to get the book or a cd of their photographs .
` we can pay the $ 150 , but it 's the principle , ' neely moldovan , from dallas , told the local channel .
` it 's not the money to us .
it 's the principle of the fact we already paid you .
' the contract simply says they will receive a '40 page 8.5 x12 storybook album with up to 80 images ' without mentioning an extra fee for the cover .
polito told nbc that she had told the couple about the $ 150 fee in an early meeting - but they said this did not happen .
` it just did n't make sense , ' andrew moldovan said .
` an album comes with a cover .
it 's a component of an album .
it 's a book .
' memories : if the couple do not pay the fee , they can not get the photo album or cd of the photos .
firm : the photographer , andrew polito -lrb- pictured -rrb- , said the extra fee was discussed before the wedding .
