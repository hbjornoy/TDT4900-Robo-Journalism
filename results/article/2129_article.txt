meanwhile , the duchess of cambridge 's mother carole , who arrived a few minutes ahead of the royal party , was resplendent in a catherine walker designed off-white dress and tailored navy coat livened up with a chic lace panel .
perfectly-groomed carole , who smiled broadly as she arrived for the intimate ceremony accompanied by husband michael and children pippa and james , teamed her coat with a soft grey satin trimmed straw hat by milliner jane corbett .
both grandmothers plumped for comfortable low-heeled leather court shoes that kept attention firmly on their outfits , .
the pair joined the duchess of cambridge , who looked elegant in a cream ruffled suit by alexander mcqueen and a # 755 bespoke jane taylor hat , and other members of the royal family including prince harry and the queen , for the event , which was attended by just 22 people .

camilla 's understated , regal style has been finessed since her 2005 wedding to prince charles , with designers such as anna valentine and bruce oldfield taking pride of place in her wardrobe .
