the model is shown here pointing out rust patches on the wheel arch - the car is 24 years old .
as well as being pictured opening the car door and sitting in the driver 's seat , sandy was also used to point out the areas of rust on the mk2 1.8-litre model .
mr dean , an estate manager , said : ' i thought it was a great idea and i 've had people ringing up about it .
` we did the same with a ride-on mower , and it sold straight away .
` the car needs a bit of work to get it back on the road , but it 's a future classic .
hopefully the doll will help sell it .
' the doll 's owner , a married father-of-three who asked not to be named , said he uses the doll for professional purposes because they come ` without the fuss ' of the real model .
he said : ` i 've asked models if they would pose for ebay adverts before and most are n't interested in it .
` poseable mannequins are ready , and do what you need them to do .
you do n't get the fuss you might get with models .
the doll , known as ` sandy ' is owned by a friend of mr dean 's - he uses her to make eye-catching ebay adverts .
