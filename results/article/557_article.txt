joy : stan and elaine ostapiak grin as they show off stan 's high school class ring , which was recently found by a man in naxos , greece .
it had been stolen from their wedding reception more than 40 years ago .
returned : the ring , which ostapiak gave to elaine when she was still his girlfriend , does n't fit him anymore .
ostapiak , 69 , graduated from a manhattan high school in 1962 and presented the ring to his wife , elaine , when she was still his girlfriend .
the ring was important to them , he said , because the students could n't afford to have a prom so it was his only memento from his high school years .
elaine put the ring on her keychain but at the couple 's wedding reception in queens on october 29 , 1972 , her purse was stolen - along with the keys and ring , as well as a few dollars .
the couple assumed that was the last they would see of it - until polykretis came across the ring while looking through his late father 's belongings .
journey : it is not known how the ring ended up in greece after it was stolen , but it was found by a man on a beach .
after the man passed away , his son found the ring among his belongings .
