there 's always got to be that guy who steps it up at a wedding .
thankfully for this reception , six-year-old harlan was there to warm up the dance floor .
literally .
dancing with himself : harlan , six , literally warmed up the dance floor at his aunt and uncle 's wedding .
his uncle logan and aunt kelly , who had just tied the knot , were swaying lovingly to crazy little thing called love .
about five other couples were also gently rocking along to the live brass band music , arm-in-arm .
but harlan had other ideas .
taking advantage of the largely abandoned floor across the hall , the little boy grabbed his head with both hands , lay on his side , and let loose .
taking it slow : the rest of the guests , plus the bride and groom , were gently swaying to the live brass band .
according to the cameraman ronnie blackburn , the party-starter was trying to impress a few of the young girls in attendance .
no doubt they came flocking shortly after .
blackburn commented on his video : ` for those who have expressed concern , i assure you that harlan is neither epileptic nor autistic ; he is just a fun-loving , energetic kid with a cute dance .
' i think he may have been trying to impress some girls at the wedding , although i 'm not sure if he picked the best dance for the job !
