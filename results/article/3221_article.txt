geraint thomas has come out swinging in the wake of a report detailing that doping is still rife in the professional world of cycling , branding the findings as ` insulting ' .
the team sky rider was reacting to claims made in the cycling independent reform commission report , which was published on monday .
in it one ` respected cycling professional ' is said to believe that 90 per cent of the peloton are still benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs .
geraint thomas has taken aim at circ 's report into doping in elite cycling , branding the findings as insulting .
the report alleges that the uci acted favourably to armstrong to protect the sport and that doping still takes place in the sport .
however , unlike in armstrong 's days , its says riders now have a choice to dope or not .
that , according to thomas , is rubbish .
` i think it 's a hell of a lot cleaner , ' he told the bbc .
` i did n't race back then , but some of the stories you hear ... it 's certainly not like that now .
` whole teams were doing it back then .
` it 's insulting when people say it -lsb- cycling -rsb- is really filthy and saying i 'm doing something wrong .
i dedicate everything to this .
` you look at older riders -- they are the most cynical about it all because they do n't know any other way .
` look at brad -lsb- wiggins -rsb- and -lsb- chris -rsb- froome .
i 'd put all the money i have on them being clean .
' thomas said he 'd bet that former tour de france champion chris froome is a clean rider .
