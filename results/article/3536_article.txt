fulfilling his dreams : jake stoneking , 19 , from west linn , oregon , drew up a 17-strong bucket list after diagnosed with medulloblastoma in 2009 .
a terminally-ill teenager has named visiting a strip club as the number one priority on his bucket list .
jake stoneking , 19 , from west linn , oregon , drew up the document of things he wishes to do before he dies after being diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2009 .
it includes hunting a wild bear , getting a tattoo and watching a ufc fight .
but the number one thing jake wanted to do was visit topless bar , jiggles , in tualatin .
and luckily for him , the club is one of the few in america that do not serve alcohol and therefore , allow under-21s into the premises .
now , the teenager has checked the wish off his list - as well as four other items , including taking a ride in a helicopter and shooting a pistol .
after jake 's visit , jiggles general manager , brian , told the new york daily news : ' i am beyond flattered and i hope that he had an amazing time .
' he added that he wished he had known about the teenager 's plans beforehand so he could have planned something special .
' i would have definitely tried to make sure that his experience there for a bucket list was a step-up from a normal experience for a customer coming off the street .
' jake , who used to be a 140lb wrestler with ` six-pack abs ' , was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 14 after suffering from a number of agonising headaches .
he underwent 12-hour surgery on the tumour in his cerebullum - the brain centre for balance and coordination - followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy .
