james sherwood , 27 , has spent the best part of the last year and a half recovering from an accident that left him in an induced coma with severe brain injury .
` it was so bad the doctors said they were surprised i could use my eyebrows again , let alone talk and walk out of there , ' he told daily mail australia .
at about 2 am on march 9 , 2013 , sherwood was hit by a taxi while crossing the road to the marrickville train station in sydney 's inner west .
he does n't remember anything from that point on but knows from hospital staff that a stranger came to his aid .
now , he is looking for that ` guardian angel ' - but all he knows is that her name starts with 'm ' .
` it could be melissa or melanie maybe , ' says sherwood .
' i really just want to let her know that the person she helped that night is alive .
i hope to meet her one day just to say thank you .
' ' i just want to thank her '' : james sherwood is looking for the woman who saved his life more than a year after he was hit by a taxi at a pedestrian crossing in marrickville in sydney 's inner west .
` when i came into emergency , the ambulance guys told my mum there was a woman who gave me first aid - they mentioned cpr - then the last thing she said was that she was going to go and clean herself up because she had my blood all over her .
' ` we know that she made calls to the hospital in the days following but her details were lost in the stress and the paperwork .
' the accident that night crushed sherwood 's upper boy , left him with a collapsed lung , a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury .
sherwood says he had been working late on a short film and was on his way home after dinner with friends .
he was looking down at his mobile phone when he walked out onto the pedestrian crossing and was hit by the taxi .
the road to recovery , he says , has been a long and strange one
