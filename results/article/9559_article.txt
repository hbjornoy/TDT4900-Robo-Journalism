charles bronson claims he is now a peace-loving artist and has changed his last name to salvador , after the famous surrealist artist .
he is one of britain 's most notorious and violent prisoners , spending the last 40 years locked in solitary confinement .
during that time charles bronson has still managed to attack 20 prison officers , take 11 hostages , and during one standoff demanded a helicopter , a blow up doll and a cup of tea .
but it seems the 61-year-old has now reinvented himself as an artist named salvador , and says he wants live out his remaining days in prison peacefully while focusing on his painting .
born as michael gordon peterson , bronson changed his name in 1987 after a bare-knuckle boxing promoter advised that it would be good for his career .
but in a recent note , penned from the inside of full sutton prison in york , bronson announced he is changing his name to charles salvador , after the famous surrealist painter .
in the rambling letter , riddled with grammatical and spelling errors , he declares : ` bronson come alive in 1987 , he died in 2014 .
' he adds : ` it 's now salvador all the way to disneyland , your welcome to join the ride but its non-violent all the way .
' he also revealed his new motto , amor vincit omnia - latin for ` love conquers all ' - before declaring ` you work it out for yourselfs , like i had too .
' the letter finishes : ` years from now you 'll all forget about bronson , i 've already forgotten .
i 'd sooner pull my teeth out than go through that hell again .
` welcome to my new dimension , is there any ladies want their a **** painting ?
cost you though , i do n't come cheap !
oh well , time to fly , i can feel an art coming on .
' now he says his greatest wish is to be released from prison before his mother eria , 84 , dies .
in a rambling letter , the life-term prisoner says bronson ` died in 2014 ' and announces ` it 's salvador all the way to disneyland ... but its 's non-violent all the way '
