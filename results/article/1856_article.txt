tony pulis has told saido berahino that being selected for england under-21s in a ` big honour in itself ' after the west bromwich albion striker missed out on a senior call-up .
berahino was in roy hodgson 's squad for the matches against slovenia and scotland last november but did not feature and will instead play for gareth southgate 's junior side against the czech republic and germany at the end of this month .
despite scoring 18 goals this season and four in his last seven games , hodgson preferred harry kane , while also recalling fit-again daniel sturridge to his squad .
