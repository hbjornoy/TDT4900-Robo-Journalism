puppy love : beatrice with pet dog max .
princess beatrice 's pet dog max has been attacked by the queen 's corgis , it was claimed last night .
the 11-year-old terrier nearly lost an ear and suffered horrific bites during the fight at balmoral a week ago , according to a source .
it comes just days after another of beatrice 's family dogs , millie , died of natural causes .
the fight is believed to have started after the queen 's six dogs were taken for a walk with the york family 's three norfolk terriers last sunday .
the queen owns three corgis , called monty , holly , willow , and three dorgis -- a dachshund and corgi cross -- named cider , candy and vulcan .
a source reportedly said : ` it was really nasty .
the queen 's dog boy was taking the corgis for a walk and they were joined by the norfolk terriers , which came -lsb- to balmoral -rsb- with prince andrew .
` they were being taken along the long corridor leading to the tower door before being let into the grounds for a walk and they all became over-excited .
` they began fighting among themselves and unfortunately the dog boy lost control .
` the next thing we knew there were horrific yelps and screams , and it seems the corgis picked on max .
' the source added that there was ` blood everywhere ' , and that the dog was ` very badly injured ' and needed to be taken to the local vet .
` the queen and duke were very upset when they were told but the dog is really beatrice 's and she was n't there either , ' the source said .
` she later came up to scotland and has been looking after max .
he was very lucky to survive .
