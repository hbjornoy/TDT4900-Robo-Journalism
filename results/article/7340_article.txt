immigration figures are ` little better than a best guess ' which could downplay the numbers coming in by 35,000 every year .
in a blistering report , mps said the statistics -- based on interviews with the equivalent of 13 immigrants a day -- were ` not fit for purpose ' .

the level of net migration , even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent , could be 35,000 higher or lower , a committee warned .
the revelations have put ministers under pressure to crack down harder if they are to hit their target of reducing net migration to the ` tens of thousands ' .
currently , cutting net migration -- the difference between the number of people arriving in the uk , and those leaving -- to anything below 100,000 would be considered a success .
but the government 's own panel of experts , the migration advisory committee , said ministers must aim for a total of 50,000 .
this was the ` only way of being certain ' the key tory election pledge had been achieved , the experts said .
in the year to june 2012 , immigration was estimated at 515,000 , while emigration was estimated at 352,000 , putting net migration at 163,000 .

mps were told that theme park has a better way of recording visitors than the uk .
but westminster 's public administration committee said the figures produced by the office for national statistics and the home office were ` blunt instruments ' and ` not adequate ' .
they are based on the international passenger survey , which interviews a tiny number of the 100million people arriving in the uk every year .
mps said just 5,000 migrants a year were identified through the survey and it had a ` large margin of error ' .
the level of net migration , even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent , could be 35,000 higher or lower , the committee warned .
