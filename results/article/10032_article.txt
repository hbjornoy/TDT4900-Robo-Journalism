a woman has hailed her pet dog as a ` guardian angel ' after it sniffed out a cancerous lump growing in her breast .
sharon rawlinson only went to see her doctor because her cavalier king charles spaniel , penny , had been pestering her for months , sniffing and nuzzling the area where the aggressive tumour was growing .
the 43-year-old was sent to hospital for checks by her gp - where a scan picked up the fact she had breast cancer .
she began a course of chemotherapy , and will have the tumour removed in an operation on monday .
mrs sharon rawlinson said her dog pestered her for weeks before she went to the doctor .
mrs rawlinson , of newark , nottinghamshire , said : ` penny was pawing me for weeks .
` she would gently paw me as if she was trying to get something out of my left breast , but i ignored it .
` when she stood on me in the middle of the night and would n't get off , the pain was like a thousand bee stings and the next day i felt bruised .
` it was only when i checked the next morning that i noticed a lump but again i ignored it as i thought it was an injury .
' mrs rawlinson , whose mother died from breast cancer nine years ago , plucked up the courage to have it checked in january .
she was diagnosed with her2-positive breast cancer and started chemotherapy .
after she started treatment , mrs rawlinson said 18-month-old penny never bothered her owner in the same way again .
the mother-of-two , a school midday supervisor , said : ` dogs are not just a man 's best friend , they 're a girl 's best friend too .
who needs diamonds ?
` she 's my guardian angel .
we bonded straight away when she was a puppy but this is just amazing .
' i feel she was sent here just for me and she never leaves my side .
if it had n't been for penny 's persistence , i would n't have gone for a check-up .
` but that 's wrong , and i would encourage anyone who thought there was something amiss to immediately see
