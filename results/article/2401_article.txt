one of the most anticipated ` coming out ' moments was when australian swimming legend ian thorpe revealed he was gay in a paid interview and now it 's being celebrated despite the move dividing the homoseuxal community .
the interview by british journalist michael parkinson , which was reported to have seen the olympian pocket up to $ 500,000 , has been nominated for a media award at this year 's honour awards which recognises achievements within nsw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex -lrb- lgbti -rrb- community .
the public revelation made global headlines while polarising the lgbti community with some believing that the 31-year-old should have felt comfortable in living an open gay life much earlier .

ian thorpe 's ` coming out moment ' has been nominated as a finalist in this year 's honour awards .
however , gay and lesbian rights lobby convenor justin koonin said acknowledgement of the exclusive interview was a positive recognition .
` it 's appropriate to recognise what the interview did and we were extremely supportive of what ian did , ' he said .
` it 's a measure of how far we have come that he has come out but it 's also a measure of how far we have to go that it ' s a media story .
' mr koonin said it was particularly hard for male athletes to deal with their sexuality .
` we would never say that a sportsperson has to come out , or any individual , and certainly we understand the pressures on athletes given his particular role in australian sport and culture , ' he said .
` things are changing but at the moment the number of openly out male athletes is very small .
' the olympian was reported to have pocketed up to $ 500,000 for the tell-all .
thorpe admitted to considering coming out at the sydney pympics in 2000 in the interview .
