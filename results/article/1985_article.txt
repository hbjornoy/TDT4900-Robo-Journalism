tackling issues : katherine preston , 29 , travelled all over america to see front line treatment for stutterers .
it was just a simple request to invite her godmother to her next ballet performance , but the moment is for ever etched in katherine preston 's memory .
as she stood in her tutu at the age of seven , her voice faltered and she was unable to get the question out .
` try as i might , i just could n't get past the b in ballet , ' she says .
` it felt like a barrier had closed the path from my lungs to my mouth .
that was the first moment i was aware i had a stutter .
' now , 22 years later , katherine 's stammer remains .
this common speech problem affects about one person in every 100 , causing them to be blocked or stuck at the beginning , middle and end of words and leading them to repeat words several times over .
the morning of our interview , i notice katherine is struggling with long , drawn-out ls , ks and ws .
` and all the rest of the alphabet , ' she laughs .
such is the impact of her stutter that five years ago katherine , now 29 , decided to quit her job in asset management in london and set off on a year-long fact-finding trip around america to work out how she could rid herself of the speech impediment .
after travelling from coast to coast to witness treatments at the forefront of stutter research , she has written a memoir about her experiences -- which also led her to fall in love with a fellow stutterer .
for in the course of that trip , it transpired that far from ruining her life , katherine 's stutter was the making of her .
` i am not sure who i would be without my stutter , ' she says .
` today i can see that stuttering has given me far more than it ever took away .
' it 's a surprisingly positive attitude for someone who , by the age of eight , had transformed from an outgoing little girl to a shy , withdrawn child as her speech let her down .
