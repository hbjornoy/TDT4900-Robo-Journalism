wayne rooney could be offered an unlikely route out of manchester united by spanish giants real madrid this summer .
with rooney now in to the last 18 months of his contract at old trafford and unlikely to sign a new one , he knows that there is no way united will sell him to one of their own domestic rivals .
however , it has emerged that real have the 28-year-old on a list of three centre forward targets this summer , behind manchester city 's sergio aguero and monaco 's unsettled colombian goalscorer radamel falcao .

manchester united star wayne rooney has emerged as a surprise target for real madrid .
re-united : any move to spain for rooney would see him link up with former team-mate cristiano ronaldo .

with city highly unlikely to let aguero go and falcao tied in to a long contract in the south of france , rooney would represent a cheaper option for madrid who are by all accounts attracted by his form this season and the fact he can play as a front-running striker or as a number ten .
madrid coach carlo ancelotti knows all about rooney from his own time at chelsea , of course , but the real driving force behind any move is president florentino perez , who has been an admirer of the england star for some time .
united will try to resist any attempts by madrid to force through a transfer , happier to let rooney run down his contract and leave for free in the summer of 2015 .
