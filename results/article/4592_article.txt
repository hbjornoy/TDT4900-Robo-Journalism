spy : 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on britain 's roads 26 million times every day .
police are recording 26million images of motorists every day -- an increase of 61 per cent since 2012 , it emerged yesterday .
senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks .
but civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight .
the images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition -lrb- anpr -rrb- cameras across the uk .
in 2012 , 16million images were recorded every day by cameras -- many of them unmarked -- which are positioned on motorways and a and b roads .
each time a vehicle passes , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's numberplate and another of the front of the car , including the driver 's face .
the cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored on a national database of 17 billion images , used by police and intelligence services to track criminals .
however , it also contains the records of innocent motorists , showing a detailed map of their daily journeys .
police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras , saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system .
it is thought that by 2018 , between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day .
the network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day .
pictures can be checked against the police national computer and used by the driver and vehicle licensing agency in the battle against crime .
the first cameras were installed in britain on the m1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles .
by 2005 , the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000 .
as well as fixed cameras , police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in london alone .
nick pickles , director of big brother watch , said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public
