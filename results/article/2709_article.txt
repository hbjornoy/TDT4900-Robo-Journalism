gone are the days of flight attendants in miniskirts , but sexism in still alive and well in the the airline industry - as evidenced by a note a passenger left to his female pilot on a flight this weekend in canada .
westjet airlines pilot carey steacy had just wrapped up a flight from victoria to calgary when cleaning crews brought her a note , written on a napkin , left behind by one of the passengers .
the note , written by a ` david ' and left at seat 12 e , tells steacy that ` the cockpit of an airliner is no place for a woman .
a woman 's place : a passenger named ` david ' left behind this sexist note aimed at female westjet airlines pilot carey steacy after a flight this weekend in canada .
sexist : in the note , david said that a woman 's greatest honor is being a mother and that they are short moms and not pilots .
' a woman being a mother is the most honor , not as `` captain '' .
we 're short mothers , not pilots westjet , ' the note continues .
` ps i wish westjet could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so i could book another flight !
in the end this is all mere vanity .
not impressed .
' the note is signed ` respectfully in love , david ' .
steacy , a mother of two , told ctv news that she is used to passengers being surprised that they have a female captain , but she has never been the target of such blatant sexism .
her male co-pilot and the female flight attendants were equally shocked by the message .
` we did n't know what to say , ' she said .
not ok : mother of two , and a pilot for 17 years , steacy shot back at the sexist passenger by posting pictures of the note on her facebook .
but eventually steacy decided to make a stand , and posted the pictures of the note on facebook to make a point that what the passenger wrote was not ok .
' i have heard many comments from people throughout my 17-year career as a pilot .
most of them positive .
