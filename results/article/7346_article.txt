a father has been arrested for assault after his own daughter posted a video on snapchat apparently showing him attacking a teenager during a road rage altercation .
steven paula , 43 , allegedly attacked 18-year-old mason deal in parker , colorado , leaving him with a black eye and a concussion - and his daughter caught the whole episode on her cell phone .
police say that the girl then posted the video on snapchat and a screenshot was saved by a friend , before the footage was deleted .
the image was then passed on to a friend of the victim and was shared with the police .
the image - which appears to show paula swinging at mr deal - allowed police to identify him as their suspect .
mason deal , 18 , said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in parker , colorado .
according to fox 31 denver , police initially had very little to go on , but the single image - which appears to show paula swinging at mr deal - allowed them to identify him as their suspect .
mr deal told the news channel : ` part of me feels bad for her thinking that it was okay to post something like that on social media - and think it was funny - but at the same time she gave us everything we needed and for that i 'm grateful .
' he said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in parker , some 20 miles from denver , that merges from two lanes to one .
the suspect allegedly tried to pass him and the two cars clipped each other .
mr deal recalled stopping his car and seeing the other driver getting out of his minivan .
he said he thought the man was going to ask him for his insurance information , but instead he attacked the teenager .
