the wardrobe is operated on a circular rail meaning it can store more clothes than a normal wardrobe , in the same amount of space .
the innovative system involves taking pictures of an item on a smartphone or tablet before placing it in the wardrobe .
sensors on the rails then detect which space the item is allocated and catalogues it .
when the owner searches for it on their smartphone , the wardrobe automatically moves the rail to the correct place to bring them the outfit .
the device 's creators say users can search by pictures , colour , type ... or even the date the item was last worn .
