they were a symbol of the fuhrer 's vision for world domination , produced a lot of dung down in deepest devon ... and now , it turns out , have ended up in some ` very tasty ' sausages .
the mouth-watering , if unfortunate , end of half of the only herd of ` nazi ' cattle in england was revealed yesterday as the farmer who owns them told how he was forced to send seven to the abattoir because they were ` incredibly aggressive ' .
derek gow , 49 , said : ` the ones we had to get rid of would just attack you any chance they could .
they would try to kill anyone .
dealing with that was not a lot of fun at all .

derek gow , 49 -lrb- pictured -rrb- , who runs upcott grange farm in lifton , devon , has been forced to get rid of seven of his auroch cows - known as ` nazi cows ' - as he could not handle their ` incredibly aggressive ' nature .
the once-extinct aurochs were brought back to life by adolf hitler 's scientists in the 1930s after officially dying out 4,000 years ago .
they arrived in britain for the first time in 2009 when mr gow imported 13 cows .
the cows in question are a relic of adolf hitler 's support for a scheme to revive the mighty auroch -- a huge beast which featured heavily in teutonic folklore .
the aurochs had been hunted to extinction in europe by 1627 , but two zoologist brothers decided to ` bring them back to life ' in a breeding plan which later won nazi support .
heinz and lutz heck mixed animals from the scottish highlands , corsica and the french camargue , as well as spanish fighting bulls .
after the fall of the nazis , the heck cattle were seen as an unwanted reminder of german oppression and efforts to build a master race , and almost all of them were destroyed .
but a few survived , and 13 were shipped from a conservation park in belgium to mr gow 's farm at broadwoodwidger on the devon-cornwall border in 2009 .
it was the first time the beasts had been seen in britain for more than 4,000
