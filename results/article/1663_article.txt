can this year 's the voice uk champion stevie mccrorie break the winners ' curse ?
his mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule .
leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer .
the very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show .
series one winner leanne mitchell , mentored to success in 2012 by sir tom jones , blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final .
but despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts .
then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100 .
some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny o'donoghue , believe leanne did n't have the right work ethic .
when asked last year about leanne 's flop , he said , ' i was told by tom jones , and by the label as well , that leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star .
' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released .
leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment ,
