manchester united are attempting to return to the summit of the premier league with the most expensive squad ever assembled in the english game .
the arrival of angel di maria this week takes the combined transfer fees of the united squad to an eye-watering # 401.2 million - and that figure could grow with new signings before the transfer window closes .
the value of united 's squad now outstrips their neighbours and defending champions manchester city , who are worth a collective # 344.15 m when the transfer fees are added up .

expensive : angel di maria 's # 60m move to manchester united from real madrid has pushed the total transfer fees of united 's squad beyond the # 400m mark .
money men : the combined transfer fees of the united squad now exceed the # 400m mark .
overtaken : united 's summer buys have seen them leapfrog neighbours city as the premier league 's most expensively-assembled squad .
manchester united # 401.2 m .
manchester city # 344.15 m .
chelsea # 341.8 m .
liverpool # 245.8 m .
arsenal # 209.5 m .
chelsea come a close third on # 341.8 m following the acquisitions of cesc fabregas and diego costa over the summer .
city 's title-winning squad from last season cost # 364.7 m to put together , while their successful team from the 2011-2012 season was worth # 334.5 m. united have so far spent # 131.7 m on four players - di maria , ander herrera , luke shaw and marcos rojo - as louis van gaal desperately tries to strengthen a squad that slumped to seventh in the table last season .
but these big money signings are merely an escalation of united 's exponential buying over the last decade with 17 members of the squad costing in excess of # 10m when they arrived at the club .
reinforcement : united announced the # 16m signing of marcos rojo from sporting lisbon last week .
incoming : luke shaw was signed from southampton earlier in the summer .
chris smalling , for instance , cost # 10m when signed from fulham in 2010 , phil jones cost # 16.5 m when he arrived from blackburn in 2011 , and wilfried zaha cost
