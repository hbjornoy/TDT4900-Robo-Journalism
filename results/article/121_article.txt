` this has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time .
' i am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future .
` liverpool football club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult , but i feel it 's something that 's in the best interests of all involved , including my family and the club itself .
` i 'm going to carry on playing and although i ca n't confirm at this stage where that will be , i can say it will be somewhere that means i wo n't be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against liverpool - that is something i could never contemplate .
` my decision is completely based on my wish to experience something different in my career and life and i also want to make sure that i have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over .
' i ca n't thank brendan , the owners and everyone at the club enough for how they 've handled this and i am leaving on great terms .
also , i would like to thank my team-mates and all the staff for their help and continued support .
` it is a very special place to be part of .
it is my sincere hope and wish that one day i can return to serve liverpool again , in whatever capacity best helps the club .
