paedophile .
in fact jail 's too good for him , ' says tracy brown .
' i feel bitter towards him .
because he 'll never realise what he 's done .
' tracy and her twin sister rachel steadwood , now 38 and from edinburgh , were just six years old when their childhood came to an abrupt end .
unbeknown to each other , both had been attacked and brutally raped by a man they considered to be family , the husband of their aunt mary , john mccallum .

despite the verdict , however , the pair say they will never get over what happened to them and will never forgive their ` monster ' uncle .
the girls ' ordeal began in the summer of 1978 , while they were staying with their much-loved aunt mary , then 16 , who was married to a 19-year-old traveller named john mccallum .

` we 'd stay in caravans , trailers , as you would class them .
it was totally exciting .
' but the idyll was about to turn into a nightmare as mccallum ,
