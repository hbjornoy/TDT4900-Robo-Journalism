harry redknapp has told shaun wright phillips to leave qpr and continue his career elsewhere -- but says the midfielder is not prepared to take a pay-cut .
wright phillips , who earns in the region of # 60,000-per-week , has played just 78 minutes for qpr this season in the capital one cup and has not started a league game since september 2013 .
and the 33-year-old , who is out of contract in the summer , says it is ` burning him up ' not knowing why he is not playing and claims when he went to see redknapp to ask why , the discussion became heated and turned into a row .
shaun wright-phillips has n't featured for qpr since the defeat by burton in august .
wright-phillips said he went to speak to manager harry redknapp about his absence from the team .
but redknapp said : ` shaun knows i have asked him to go on loan .
but he is not going to go when he has a great deal here .
` i ca n't understand why someone does not want to play .
we all get upset with people 's attitudes , but he is not going to move .
` it 's not the player 's fault .
it is the person who gave him the contract , it 's their fault ' blackburn , bolton and charlton have all shown interest in signing the player that chelsea paid manchester city # 21million for in 2005 -- only for the player to turn them all down .
redknapp also confirmed qpr would let wright phillips leave permanently on a free transfer -- but says there has been no interest from anyone in the premier league and championship clubs would not be able to match his current wages .
redknapp added : ` it is very difficult when you earn that much money to go and play anywhere else .
` when you are earning x amount of pounds and somebody wants to pay you a fraction of that , you are not going to move .
` now shifting him when he is not in your plans is difficult .
