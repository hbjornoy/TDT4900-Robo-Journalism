a woman who negotiated a year-long ` open marriage ' with the husband she 'd been with for 17 years and took the chance to sleep with 12 strangers has opened up about her wild year .
robin rinaldi , 50 , had always considered herself a ` good girl ' , but ended up being so transformed by what she referred to as her ` wild oats project ' that she left her husband after the 12 months ended .
rinaldi , who lives in san francisco , had previous slept with only four men including husband scott mansfield .
` wild oats ' : robin wright , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship .
but during her year of abandon , she bedded ten men and two women , whom she picked up online , in bars and at sex classes .
she made the life-changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 - and has written a book about her exploits called the wild oats project .
rinaldi described her relationship with mansfield , a brewer and wine-maker , as ` stuck in a rut ' , adding that ` our once-a-week sex life was loving , but lacked spontaneity and passion ' .
but she decided to make the change after begging him for years to have a child with her , and finally realizing that he would n't after he got a vasectomy .
struggle : wright said her husband , scott mansfield , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead .
reliving the fraught decision in her book , she wrote : ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... if i ca n't have one , i must have the other ' .
under the terms of her new deal , rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests .
but over the weekend she would go back to mansfield , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart .
