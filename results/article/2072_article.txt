medics at the hospital found mr ou had experienced spontaneous pneumothorax -- this occurs when air becomes trapped next to a lung .
most cases occur spontaneously and in young men - some cases develop as a result of a chest injury or lung disease and sometimes a tiny tear in the lung is responsible .
the most common symptom is a sudden , sharp chest pain followed by pains during inhalation .
in most cases , it clears without needing treatment but the air needs clearing if it causes problems with breathing .
it is believed that mr ou tore a hole in his lung while yawning and stretching as he suffered a sudden pain immediately after yawning .

the condition occurs in about two in every 10,000 young adults but men are four times more likely to be affected than women .
