everton defender antolin alcaraz has likened his injury-plagued first season at the club to being in prison.the paraguay international followed his manager roberto martinez from wigan last summer but did not make his debut until december 29 , managing only seven appearances in total .
in his absence the 20-year-old john stones established himself as a more than capable deputy to phil jagielka and sylvain distin , both of whom suffered injuries of their own in the second half of the season .
rare sight : antolin alcaraz -lrb- left -rrb- played just seven times for everton this season .
alcaraz is now looking forward to having a full pre-season and proving his worth .
` on a personal level , it 's one to put behind me , ' the centre-back told evertontv .
nightmare : alcaraz slumps on the deck after putting through his own net against southampton .
` it 's one to forget almost as it 's been full of negatives .
` the frustration as a player is that an injury stops you doing what you most enjoy .
` it 's almost like it is taking your liberty away from you and you become a prisoner in your own situation .
` but it 's gone now and it 's not worth looking back and feeling sorry for yourself .
happier times : alcaraz 's form for wigan persuaded roberto martinez to take him to everton .
` you have to look ahead , be positive and i 'm looking forward to next season and hoping for better things .
' i took solace in is that i was able to play a few games towards the end of the season and physically i came through those okay , and that is promising for next season .
` what i want more than anything is to make sure that i am 100 per cent fit , totally free from injuries and have the chance to do what i do .
