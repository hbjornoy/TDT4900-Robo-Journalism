a mountain of binbags has built up in a block of flats after council binmen made just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an eu law .
residents in a block of flats in colchester , essex , were told red tape means the binmen ca n't collect rubbish there when it 's too dark for them to see it .
as a result , the massive pile of 70 stinking black binbags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile .
overflowing : flats resident jill bowyer with the rubbish bin men refused to collect piled up in the bin area .
furious residents stepped in to demand the binmen take away the black bags .
but they were stunned when the binmen told them that the eu regulations mean they ca n't put their hands where they ca n't see them for health and safety reasons .
the binmen have now refused to collect any more rubbish from the flats , saying they ca n't be seen to be breaking the rules .
many of the bags now spilling out of the store are split and rats have already been spotted in the area just yards from people 's front doors .
too dark : the heaps of rubbish at the flats in colchester , essex .
the block of flats in colchester where a massive pile of 70 stinking black bin bags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store .
health and safety rules have left residents of the block of flats in colchester with eight weeks of rubbish .
block resident jill mawby said : ` we .
thought the binmen had forget to come into the flats so we waited .
around to have a word with them .
` but .
when we spoke to them about it , they said if they can not see where they .
are putting their hands , then they ca n't pick up the bags because of eu .
law .
` there were 12 binmen , yet they could not collect our rubbish .
it 's utter madness .
' residents from the block of flats use the communal store for their bins which should be picked up on a weekly basis by workers from colchester borough
