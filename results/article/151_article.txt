instant respect : louis van gaal is a mad genius and is prone to ` going off his head ' , according to scholes .
` from what i 've seen -lrb- van gaal -rrb- looks a bit mad .
he 's a bit like a mad genius , a bit crazy .
he 's obviously very good at his job from where he 's been .
i 've not seen him work but i have seen clips on the telly and one moment he 's hugging someone for doing a great pass and the next , if something 's not right , he 's going off his head .
he 's brought a bit of fear , which is no bad thing .
' i played for 20 years for sir alex ferguson and he could be a scary man .
fear can bring performances from you .
there 's no doubt these players need to perform this year .
if they do n't , i do n't think they 'll be there for very long .
` players will know where they stand , which is what you want .
you knew where you stood with sir alex from what you 'd done on the saturday .
if you 'd done well , he 'd pat you on the back .
if you had n't , you probably would n't be playing the next week .
' united finished seventh in the premier league last season and fired manager david moyes in april after they lost to everton .
