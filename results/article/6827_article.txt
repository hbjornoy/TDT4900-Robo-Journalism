elsewhere , paul lambert is hoping to keep hold of defender ron vlaar amidst interest from ronald koeman 's southampton .
lambert is keen to open talks with the 29-year-old centre-half once the transfer window shuts , but was far from impressed with koeman for admitting publicly that vlaar was ` an option ' .
the villa boss said : ` there is been absolutely no enquiry , not one iota on it .
the only thing i am disappointed in is people talking about him , who should know better than to talk about other people 's players .
` i do n't think you accept it .
i think out of respect you do n't do it , you do n't get involved in that .
that is my opinion .
you will have to ask others what they think but i am just giving my opinion .
' staying ?
