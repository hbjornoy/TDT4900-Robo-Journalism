a sister has received offers from dozens of from potential suitors ... after her brother decided to place a ` commercial ' pleading for a date for her on facebook , gumtree and the free ads website .
adam clarke , 26 , decided it was about time his older sibling natalie got a boyfriend , so he posted a video about his sister online .
` she has n't had a boyfriend for a long while , ' he says in the home-made clip , filmed in his car .
` do n't know whether it 's because she 's infertile , she 's too old , whatever .
' ` i 'm not going to go into that because she 'll kick off .

adam recorded a video of his sister which he posted online alongside an advert for a date with her .
although she admits she was originally cross with her brother , natalie now is enjoying sifting through the responses from men hoping to date her - having whittled it down to between five and eight suitors .
` we need to get her a boyfriend because she 's doing my head in !
' his unwitting sister then gets into the car , looking a tad taken aback when he explains what he 's doing .
he then continues : ` if anyone 's interested , she 's 33 , she 's got her own car , runs her own business , she 's ... i 've run out of things to say about you .
anyway , if you 're interested , add her on facebook .
' adam put the video on facebook without his sister 's knowledge and then shared it on different sites such as free ads and gumtree .
when natalie found out about the video she said ` at first i was shocked and kicked off but then i began to see the funny side and now i 'm thankful ' .
the fact it was an an instant success and sparked multiple responses in just 24 hours may have helped .
` my laptop has not stopped beeping since , ' says natalie .
