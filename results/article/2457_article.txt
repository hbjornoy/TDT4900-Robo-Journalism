the world 's carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control .
scientists from the un have warned that emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels .
other greenhouse gases , such as methane , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- , need to follow suit so that , overall , greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero between 2080 and 2100 .
scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels -lrb- pictured -rrb- , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels .
a certain level of carbon is emitted naturally , but the report refers to reducing man-made emission to zero - referred to as net zero .
the stark report , by the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- said that emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century , in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions , such as widespread droughts .
countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 °c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but unep said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions will be ` way beyond safe limits ' .
it warned that even if countries meet their existing pledges to cut emissions , the world will exceed the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted to keep temperature rises within safe levels - by 10 billion tonnes by 2020 , and 17 billion tonnes by 2030 .
countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 °c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected , such as melting ice caps and rising sea levels -lrb- illustrated -rrb- - but unep said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions would be ` way beyond safe limits ' to have a good chance of staying below 2 °c , greenhouse gas emissions should drop by around 15 per cent or more
