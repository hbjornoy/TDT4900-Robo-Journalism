a woman whose leg muscles were shredded in the boston bombing has shown extraordinary determination as she prepares to run a marathon this weekend .
lee ann yanni , 31 , was standing 10 feet from the finish line with her husband nick , 32 , when the first of two homemade bombs detonated on april 15 , killing three and injuring more than 270 .
shrapnel shattered her fibula and tore her leg muscles - but just six months and three surgeries later , she will be taking part in sunday 's chicago marathon .
' i do n't care if i have to walk , crawl or piggyback , ' she told the boston herald .
` i 'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me .
' fighter : lee ann yanni 's left leg was broken and her muscle was torn by shrapnel in the boston marathon bombing in april .
in an astonishing show of determination , she is running a marathon on sunday .
yanni , who had to learn how to walk again after her devastating injuries , is running in memory of her father , who died of cancer this time last year .
although this is her first full marathon , before the april blast she had ran numerous road races and half marathons .
she now hopes to finish the 26.2 mile race in about six hours .
even taking part in the race is an astonishing feat , considering less than six months ago she was in hospital for eight days after undergoing surgery .
the blast caused blood to pour from her leg as shrapnel broke the bone in her left leg and lodged inside , and tore muscles .
her husband nick escaped with just a pierced eardrum .
back out there : yanni , a physical therapist , knows she will be running far slower but wants to complete it .
strong : she is running the chicago marathon in memory of her father , who died of cancer last year .
` it was a very large boom , ' she said in an interview afterwards .
` it just sounded like fireworks .
