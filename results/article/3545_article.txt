jewell berggrun , pictured , was swindled out of $ 500 from a ` suitor ' on a christian dating site .
a woman says she was scammed out of $ 500 from a would-be suitor on a christian dating site .
jewell berggrun , 54 , from winder , georgia , told wsbtv that the man called her twice a day -- and that she fell in love before realizing what was going on .
' i put my heart out there , he took it and destroyed it , ' she told the channel .
after her husband died of a heart attack , berggrun turned to the free christian dating site to find new love .
she told wsbtv that she quickly fell for ` alexi , ' a man who said he was a texas resident and did business in malaysia .
` alexi ' told berggrun ran into money problems , asking her for $ 8,000 , the channel adds .
she ended up giving him $ 500 through a wire transfer .
berggrun quickly realized that ` alexi ' may not have been who he said he was , when she found out his photos were on three different dating sites using three different names , she said .
on top of her recent troubles , berggrun told wsbtv that she is on disability and on a fixed income .
' i ca n't get any medication or groceries for the rest of the month , ' she said .
authorities say it is unlikely she will get her money back from the man .
berggrun , seen here with her late husband terrell , went on the dating site looking for a new shot at love .
her dating site experience is similar to one mailonline reported on earlier this month , where a divorcee was scammed out of $ 500,000 on christian mingle.com .
the woman , 66 , said she had been in contact with a irish man named ` david holmes ' -- only to later find out he was nigerian .
his dating profile picture was allegedly that of a male model downloaded elsewhere .
she was eventually convinced by ` david holmes ' to wire him $ 300,000 , followed by another $ 200,000 to a turkish bank , mail online reported
