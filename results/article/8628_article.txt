the teenager , who was hit by the spray of the shot , fled before she even hit the floor .
relieving the moment her mother was killed , she told the sun today : ` he walked into the house with the gun raised , aiming it at my mum 's back .
` he had this focused , determined look as if he was about to shoot a rabbit or a pheasant .
he definitely targeted my mum , he wanted her first .
i wanted to get words out but my mouth would n't let me .
it was like a nasty dream .
' the weapon was one of several firearms atherton held legally .
during the attack , musical theatre student miss mcgoldrick managed to escape with her boyfriend myren grant , 19 , through her bedroom window .
her stepbrother michael , the 17-year-old son of atherton , 42 , and mrs mcgoldrick , also escaped .
the teenager added : ' i am surprised he did n't run upstairs after me .
i 'm very lucky that i escaped .
he would definitely have killed me if he had the chance .
' miss mcgoldrick described atherton as a ` jekyll and hyde '
