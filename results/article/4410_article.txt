romance is in the air for arsene wenger this week .
or it should be .
if there 's one champions league last-16 clash that tugs at the heartstrings then it 's arsenal 's clash against monaco .

` the last 16 in recent years has been super-tough , ' said wenger .
` but this is a 50-50 game .
monaco are very tight defensively and they conceded once in the group stage .
it is two good teams .
so for us , it 's a tricky but a possible tie .
