the son of banana farmer from the northern nsw town of macksville who was dropped from the australian test team five times , but who never gave up is being remembered for his defiant attitude in the face of adversity .
as cricketers , friends and family gathered around his bedside at st vincents hospital for the 48 hours following his injury , the prayers and tributes for hughes - as a cricketer , a mate and a great bloke - poured in .
` hughesy ' or ` hugh-dog ' , as he was nicknamed , was an immensely likeable and also humble , understated and hardworking team mate for the australian , south australian and adelaide strikers squads .
