this is the haunting sight of a ` car graveyard ' nestled in a belgian forest , where vintage motors sit rusting among the fronds .
the old-fashioned vehicles are thought to have been left in the wood near the village of chatillon by u.s. soldiers who were stationed in southern belgium during world war ii .
when the war ended , military troops were sent home , but could not afford to ship the cars they had bought and hid them in the forest .
since then , other cars have been added to the cemetery , many by soldiers stationed in the area after the war .
