my beatle brother : louise harrison poses with george in the sixties .
as a beatle , george harrison always hankered for the quiet life - it was his eldest sister , louise , told since she was a little girl that she could be the next shirley temple , who longed to be famous .
neither of them got their wish .
the former beatle died in november 2001 , leaving more than # 100million in his will , as well as friar park , his huge gothic pile in henley-on-thames , just one of a number of lavish homes around the world .

the harrisons were brought up to be self-reliant and louise says she is not the type to whinge about her lot .
she tells me she is financially ` struggling ' but quickly adds : ` but would n't you say everyone is ?
' her one-bedroom mobile home - she has another next door - may not be worth very much , but at least she owns them and the land they are on , unlike the thousands with heavily mortgaged homes they ca n't afford , she says .
` george never enjoyed being rich - he said that the beatles were just targets when they became rich and there was always some predator coming after them .
every golddigger in the world was after the beatles , ' she says .
` i did n't want to become a millionaire after what happened to him .
i wo n't even buy a lottery ticket for fear of winning .
' she does n't mind not living in a castle , she adds .
she would rather be broke than wealthy and heartless .
this is perhaps just as well since , as she revealed yesterday , not only was she completely left out of her brother 's will , but the monthly $ 2,000 -lrb- # 1,250 -rrb- pension he had set up for her in 1980 - and meant her to have for
