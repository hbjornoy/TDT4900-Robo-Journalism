a minister mistakenly signed a new law to allow england 's most notorious football hooligans to attend the world cup finals this summer .
police minister damian green thought the signature he put to the legal document would ban them from brazil .
but the dates were wrong and he barred them from just the opening day instead of the entire tournament .
the blunder would have left 2,500 of the worst troublemakers free to cause mayhem , but thankfully one of mr green 's team spotted the mistake and redrafted the law with the correct dates .
every season thousands of fans arrested for hooliganism are given banning orders .
and for each world cup , police and home office officials draw up measures to make sure thugs can not attend the tournament by forcing them to surrender their passports between certain dates .
but the so-called statutory instrument stated a travel ban would start on june 2 , ten days before the opening ceremony , but mistakenly added it would end on june 13 , rather than july 13 .
june 13 is the first full day of matches , while england 's opening game against italy is on june 14 .
the law was laid before parliament on january 29 , but the home office said officials then spotted the mistake .
a corrected version went before parliament on thursday .
` an amendment order was drafted immediately , ' a spokesman said .
