one wrote on ufo stalker : ` at approximately 4:43 am i was in my back yard having a cigarette .
` the sky was crystal clear , and as usual i was looking up at the sky , looking at the orion constellation .
` then in front of me i saw a bright green , white , blue , light with a tail .
` reminding me of a falling star , except much larger , and slower .
strange : the light slowly faded as the object drifted out of view slowly and steady as others saw it to be blue .
` then i thought of the meteor over russia .
as i watched this object , i had time to think how big it appeared , and that it was traveling silently .
` it lasted several seconds , four to eight .
as it moved across my field of vision the tail seemed to be sparking , or breaking off in pieces .
` it was close enough that i expected to hear a crash , as it seemed to be traveling in a downward direction .
` as it travelled -lrb- sic -rrb- behind structures and out of my sight , i thought i should go see if i could find it , thinking that it would have come down very close .
' i did not go though .
i do not know what it was .
i know it was not a simple falling star .
