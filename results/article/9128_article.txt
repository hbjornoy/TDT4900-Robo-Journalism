there can be few things more annoying for the keen gardener than greenflies munching away on your prized roses .
but for those not keen on using chemical pesticides , one gardening expert has come up with a solution -- delivering live ladybirds to your door .
sarah raven , a guest presenter on gardener 's world , has started selling the insects through her website , sarahraven.com .
tackling the problem : a ladybird feeds on greenfly , pests which feed at plants .
the ladybirds are put into tubes where they live happily on a diet of popcorn or cereal while being delivered by first class post .
mrs raven said : ` ladybirds are brilliant in the garden because they feed off green and black fly , as well as other insect pests who would otherwise be munching on your home-grown flowers and produce .
` they are a chemical-free alternative to pesticides , so are great for the organic gardener .
` they will get rid of pests without affecting your crops or being harmful to other wildlife .
` they are sent by first class post in their own little box which contains a packed lunch of popcorn or cereal to keep them happy .
transport : the ladybirds are put into tubes where they live happily on a diet of popcorn or cereal while being delivered by first class post .
` on the day that they arrive they should be stored somewhere cool until the late evening when they can be released out into the garden .
' once established , they should start breeding -- and help solve your greenfly problems for years to come .
mrs raven , who runs a gardening school at her farm in sussex , said : ` releasing ladybirds should lead to a permanent decrease in the number of pests in your garden -- each ladybird will eat about 500 aphids -lrb- greenfly -rrb- and will soon produce ladybird larvae which in turn also eat aphids .
' the ladybirds will be available from may until august .
