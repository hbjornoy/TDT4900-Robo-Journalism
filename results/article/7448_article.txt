when carrying out a daylight robbery , a good getaway vehicle is essential .
so one might question why these two burglars used a scooter to transport the safe they had just ripped out of a house .
the picture was taken by a passer-by moments after the pair had broken into a property in beckenham , kent , and rode off with the safe containing # 2,000 of jewellery .
brazen : the two thieves use a scooter to haul away the stolen safe from the family home in beckenham , making off with # 2,000 worth of jewellery .
owner natasha rayasam , 33 , has now .
offered a # 500 reward for the safe return of her family heirlooms , which .
included her wedding rings , along with 17 pieces of 22 carat gold .
jewellery .
ms rayasam believes the pair used a metal detector to locate the 176lbs safe , which was bolted to floor of a wardrobe in the master bedroom , because no other valuables were taken during the burglary .
she told the evening standard : ` they went straight to the wardrobe of the master bedroom and then to the study where they found our safe , which was bolted to the floor of a wardrobe .
` we think they used a metal detector to find it .
i do n't know how they removed it .
they did n't touch anything else in the house - laptops or phones .
all they wanted was the jewellery .
