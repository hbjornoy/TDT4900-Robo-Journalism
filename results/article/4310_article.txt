record numbers of anorexia sufferers -- some aged just nine -- are being admitted to hospital , according to shocking figures .
every night , 350 hospital beds across england on average are taken up by a patient desperately ill with anorexia , bulimia or another eating disorder .
the figures have doubled in a decade .
last year , 15 children aged only between five and nine were admitted to hospital with eating disorders , underlining fears that unhealthy obsessions with food are developing very early .
there is also growing concern that the nhs is worsening the crisis by refusing to treat patients because they are not deemed thin enough .
many clinics turn patients away until they fall below a certain body weight .
one young woman told this when she appealed for help condemned it as a ` perverse incentive ' to lose weight .
the figures come after the nhs was heavily criticised in a report by the patients association .
it revealed how a gifted 19-year-old died following failings by gps , hospital doctors and psychologists .
averil hart was meant to have weekly check-ups but was allowed to become so thin that she slurred her words and was later found collapsed in her student flat .
patients with anorexia , bulimia or other eating disorders accounted for 122,150 bed nights in 2012/13 .
this is up from 100,550 in 2011/12 , said the health and social care information centre .
in contrast , 51,878 bed days were taken up by such patients in 2002/3 .
a total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year , three-quarters with anorexia .
the figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months .
girls aged 15 are by far the most likely to be taken to hospital , with 200 admitted last year .
charities said these figures are the ` tip ' of the iceberg as they do not include thousands of sufferers battling eating disorders at home .
