england captain chris robshaw talks to the media at england 's pennyhill park training base on wednesday .
` i think we have come a long way since then , ' said the england captain .
` we were a side that was very defence-orientated and we prided ourselves on that defence .
we probably won a lot of games because of that .
` our attack has now caught up with that .
now we can play both sides .
we can threaten with our attack and have that dominant defence as well .
` the experience and composure of the guys has come on a long way .
there were a lot of single-figure caps back then .
guys have now been round the world and played in some intimidating arenas , and excelled there .
' robshaw also sent out a warning to his team-mates saying there will be ` no hiding places ' against new zealand .
he added : ` there 's no hiding place .
we 're not going into this game to come out second best .
you ca n't stand off these guys for a second .
it 's about us putting our game out there .
` you have to defend extremely well and take your chances - there is no magic formula to beating them .
` in the pressure of the situation it 's about who is able to do that and keep their composure .
it 's about being clinical .
