leeds united owner massimo cellino could soon face an unprecedented charge of misconduct from the football league that may end his troubled stay at elland road .
and with cellino bankrolling the yorkshire club to the tune of # 40million , there would be a danger of leeds going out of business if the italian is forced out .
the league 's board , who met this week , have lost patience with the cellino camp over the long delay in receiving the written reasons why cellino was found guilty by a sardinian court of evading import tax duty on his yacht .
leeds owner massimo cellino could be set to face a misconduct charge by the football league .
the view of the fl directors that is cellino and his representatives are involved in withholding the six-page judgement by sardinian judge dr sandra lepore that has reportedly been available for over two months .
the next step will be to charge leeds with misconduct if they do n't receive it .
dr lepore 's findings are reported to say cellino acted with ` elusive intent ' in evading the # 305,000 duty when his boat the nelie moored in cagliari .
and that would be enough to deem cellino to have acted dishonestly , and so fail the league 's owners and directors test .

it is understood neither cellino nor his london lawyers mishcon de reya have a copy of the judge 's report .
however cellino 's italian legal representative prof giovanni cocco has possession of the document .
but cocco has no intention of handing it over to the football league , who he believes influenced the judgement , and has further complicated matters by lodging an appeal against lepore 's findings .
meanwhile , fellow crisis club fulham have had a bid rejected to take chelsea goalkeeper mark schwarzer , 42 , back on loan .
