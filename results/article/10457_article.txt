liverpool legend and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher has launched a scathing attack on arsenal defender and world cup-winner per mertesacker .
the german centre half looked short on form and confidence as the gunners lost 3-2 to stoke at the britannia stadium , and carragher believes mertesacker let his team-mates , and in particular his fellow defenders , down .
` what confidence does that -lrb- type of performance -rrb- give the young lads around him , ' carragher said on sky sports 1 's monday night football .
jamie carragher described per mertesacker 's performance against stoke city as ` unacceptable ' peter crouch scored within the first 25 seconds against arsenal and mertesacker was partly at fault .
` he 's got to help these -lrb- younger defenders -rrb- and protect them and stop them getting asked questions .
` you 're in a game away at stoke in a tough venue - let your players around you know you 're not going to accept what 's going on .
` this is your captain on the day .
we talk about leadership , character - like -lrb- arsene -rrb- wenger always talks about after the game .
` he 's abandoned ship , he 's left them on their own and that is not acceptable for a player of that quality and experience .
he 's abandoned ship .
it 's just not acceptable .
' arsenal struggled to deal with bojan -lrb- right -rrb- for large periods - calum chambers was sent off for this challenge .
young full back hector bellerin also looked as though he could have used more guidance from mertesacker .
