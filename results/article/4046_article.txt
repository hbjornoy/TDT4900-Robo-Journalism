a photo of president barack obama was mistakenly used by a fox news affiliate to represent a suspect in a college sexual assault case .
the photo of the president appeared on kswb when anchor kathleen bade said ` the only suspect in a sex assault at sdsu -lrb- san diego state university -rrb- will not be charged .
' kswb soon cut to footage of a different man with authorities , as bade announced ` the district attorney 's office says they decided not to file charges against 20-year-old francisco sousa because the evidence against him is weak .
' mistake : a photo of president obama popped up during a report on a sexual assault suspect .
according to the times of san diego , the photo of obama - which had the words ` no charges ' underneath it - was shown friday at 10:04 pm .
the times of san diego was the first to report on kswb 's error .
in an interview with the newspaper , kswb assignment editor mike wille said the image was up for approximately 5 seconds and instantly spotted .
wille told the times of san diego ` yeah , there was an accident when they had an over-the-shoulder .
it was n't on purpose .
' the assignment editor also said he did not know what time bade learned about the obama photo .
he told the times of san diego ` they really do n't do that when it 's a small thing like that ' in response to a question from the newspaper over a potential live acknowledgement or apology .
no one phoned kswb in the middle of friday 's 10pm news regarding the photo , wille told the news outlet .
kswb did not immediately respond to a request for comment from daily mail online .
error : an assignment editor with kswb has said the image was up for approximately 5 minutes and instantly spotted .
