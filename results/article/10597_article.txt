patrick coppeard , 49 , a former managing director at merrill lynch , conned friends out of more than # 5.4 million in a ponzi scam .
a retired city banker who cheated churchgoers out of millions in a vast fraud told one victim over the phone : ` god has told me to give you a ring .
' over five years patrick coppeard collected nearly # 5.4 million , most of which he blew in online gambling while trying to make up for losses .
when he finally handed himself into police and was asked how much he had left in his account , the former broker for investment bank merrill lynch replied : ` zip-a-dee-doo-dah .
' the married father of three , a former magistrate , has now been jailed for six years after admitting a single charge of fraud by abuse of position .
he had already moved out of his # 1.25 million house in loughton , essex , and into a more modest home near harlow .
victims , many left virtually penniless by the scam , complained yesterday that the sentence was ` pathetic ' .
david jacques , 53 , a fellow member of st john 's church in buckhurst hill , said he was phoned by coppeard two days after selling his house .
` he told me , `` david , you may not believe this but god has asked me to give you a ring '' , ' mr jacques said .
` he guaranteed the money himself and offered me 6 per cent interest .
' the power-wash business owner invested # 50,000 before ploughing another # 283,000 into the bogus scheme .
he added : ` i 'd known him for 20 years from church .
i knew he was a financial man and a magistrate so i trusted him .
i 'm now saddled with a # 33,000 credit card debt ... i think the sentence is pathetic for what he 's done .
' another victim , former next-door neighbour rob smith , 50 , said coppeard had been one of his closest friends before the ` immense betrayal ' .
` we thought we were investing into a share trading club and patrick was handling it on our behalf due to his experience as a stockbroker , ' he said .
