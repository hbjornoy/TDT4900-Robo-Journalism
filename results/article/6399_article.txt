if there 's one person who knows how to power dress , it 's carol vorderman .
at 53 , the former countdown presenter has never looked better so it comes as no surprise that isme.com has invited her to front its range for a second year running .

speaking to mailonline about the new range , carol said : ` there 's plenty of leather , which i love , as well as fabulous christmas dresses .
i absolutely love the longer skirts as i think they 're much more elegant .
' sharing her summer style tips , carol , who says she ` does n't like to dress up too much ' in the hotter climes , said : ' i love high-waisted trousers and shorter summer dresses .
i think it 's so important to just be comfortable in what you 're wearing .
` do n't look at a 6ft 2in skinny model and think `` i want to look like her '' - look to people who are your shape and emulate them .
' isme 's latest collection aims to stay .
true to the brand 's ethos with a range that 's designed to add style to a woman 's everyday life , whatever your age or size - something carol knows all about .
carol has become an unofficial postergirl for mature women and is never afraid to experiment with her style or embrace more daring outfits .
poster girl : carol has long maintained that fashion is n't about age and believes you should dress however you like -lrb- blue blouse , # 29 , pencil skirt , # 20 , red peep toe heels , # 30 -rrb- .
how does she do it ?
despite being over fifty , carol looks younger than ever .
