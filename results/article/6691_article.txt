lord carey , pictured , is certain any moves to change the law on gay marriage will put society ` on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking ' david cameron 's plans to allow gay marriage could have ` drastic ' consequences , even allowing men to marry more than one woman , the former archbishop of canterbury will warn conservatives tomorrow .
in a speech at this week 's party conference , lord carey will say same-sex marriages ` strike at the very fabric of society ' .
he will say it is difficult to know at this stage what the consequences would be if gay marriage were introduced , according to a draft seen by the mail on sunday .
but he will cite developments in other countries where the law is being liberalised , including france , where the government intends to ban the words ` mother and father ' from official documents , replacing them with ` parents ' .
lord carey , who also writes in the mail on sunday today that the government needs to confront the ` divisive ' issue of immigration , will add : ` we can be sure any move away from our traditional understanding of marriage is to put our society on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking .
' i note , for example , that on august 28 the bbc reported that a public notary in sao paulo has accepted a civil union between a man and two women .
` once we move from the solid ground of marriage earthed in that time-honoured relationship of a man and woman , in a loving relationship open to procreation , we can be sure the result will not strengthen the life of society and will not greatly help the life chances of our children .
' lord carey will cite developments in other countries where gay marriage has been legalised as reasons why it should be blocked in the uk .
