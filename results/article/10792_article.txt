her dark hair piled in a stylish bun atop her head and resplendent in a black and silver salwar kameez , shaheen qureshi , from bradford , looks every inch the glamorous working mother .
but while qureshi might not look unusual , her second marriage was anything but .
for , like many thousands more , the mother-of-eight was once a ` co-wife ' to a polygamous husband .
yet despite being open to the idea of a second polygamous union , qureshi admits that her first did n't exactly go to plan .
divorced : shaheen qureshi recently divorced her second husband whom she shared with a co-wife .
' i met him at a car wash , ' she beams , remembering the day she met the man who would become her second husband .
' i went to clean my car and came back with a husband .
everyone always jokes that i should n't be allowed to go to a car wash in case i end up married again !
' then a single mother following the break-up of her first marriage to a pakistani cousin , qureshi says she was looking for companionship and a ` stable family life ' .
what she got was something quite different , with her british muslim husband spending a total of just six months in her company over their 10-year marriage .
` the second marriage really suited me at first , ' she explains .
' i had seven children , some with special needs , and i just wanted to have a husband .
not much time : shaheen says she did n't get to spend as much time with her husband as she expected to .
commonplace : an estimated 20,000 polygamous families live in the uk , even though it is illegal under uk law .
` we were really similar ; there were only six months between us .
we had both been married before and we had the same level of thinking .
' i did n't want to be on my own , i wanted support .
a part-time marriage really suited me .
' and qureshi is certainly not the only woman to think so , with an estimated 20,000 polygamous marriages estimated to exist in the uk alone - nearly all of which are between muslims .
