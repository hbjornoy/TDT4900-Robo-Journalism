aldi is piling pressure on the supermarket giants by pledging to double its number of stores nationwide .
buoyed by the scale of its success in attracting millions of new customers , the german discount chain has vowed to double its size to 1,000 stores in the next seven years , according to a report yesterday .
tesco , asda , sainsbury 's and morrisons have seen their profits fall as more families switch to aldi 's cheaper products .
aldi claims it will be adding between 50 and 65 new stores a year until 2021 when they should have 1,000 stores across the country .
joint managing director matthew barnes said that aldi plans to accelerate store openings from 50 to 65 a year from next year .
if it achieves that rate of growth every year , it will hit 1,000 stores by 2021 .
it also plans to upgrade its existing stores .
` for the foreseeable future , 65 new stores a year is not out of the question , ' mr barnes said .
` we think 1,000 stores is an absolute possibility .
' by contrast the biggest supermarkets have been struggling -- tesco 's sales fell 3.1 per cent and morrisons ' sales were down 3.9 per cent .
the discounter is also working on plans to upgrade its existing stores to boost sales and steal even more customers from its big rivals .
aldi says that it has been building extensions and bigger car parks because in some locations it has been a victim of its own success leading to bottlenecks in car parks or at tills .
retail experts believe that the discount retailers are benefiting as they seek better value than that on offer from traditional supermarkets such as tesco , asda , sainsbury 's and morrisons .
