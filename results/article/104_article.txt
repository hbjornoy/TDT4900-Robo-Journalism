we will be taking a look at players new to the premier league with the potential to light up england 's top tier over the coming campaign .
fraser forster in a nutshell .
forster has been at the heart of everything that celtic have achieved over the past five seasons and he will hope to continue that success on the south coast with new club southampton .
having signed for ronald koeman 's side in a # 10million deal earlier in august , the england international has gone straight into southampton 's side as their no 1 goalkeeper .
the 26-year-old is big - he stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall - and he is a huge presence in goal , filling out the frame and intimidating opposition strikers .
he made his premier league bow for southampton against liverpool on sunday and , although he was beaten twice , he looked composed and relaxed in his new environment .
ready ?
