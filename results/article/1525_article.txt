a mother kept her son alive for twelve minutes using chest compressions after his heart stopped when he choked on a biscuit .
debbie eggenton thought 19-year-old keegan was dying when he went into cardiac arrest at their home in westcliff , essex .
she jumped out of bed and began pumping on his chest until paramedics arrived and used a defibrillator to restart his heart .
mrs eggenton said : ` the first thing i knew , keegan 's girlfriend came in and said she had tried to wake him up and could n't get a response .
` i jumped out of bed and ran into his room and started screaming .
` his girlfriend called the ambulance service , who said put him on the floor and start cpr .
` i 'd never done it before so i copied what i had seen on tv .
` i was shouting `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , '' as i pushed on his chest while my husband talked in his ear .
` all of a sudden the police arrived and i heard a voice in my ear : `` would you like me to take over .
'' ` i was thinking he was dead and i collapsed on the floor , then i went to the kitchen and threw up in the sink .
' paramedics and a doctor arrived quickly and praised the teenager 's parents .
aaron hughes , one of the paramedics who was reunited with mr eggenton as he thanked the team for bringing him back to life , said : ` it was a really scary situation for the family and they managed admirably .
` it shows the importance of knowing cpr and just pushing hard and fast on the chest is the most effective thing you can do as it keeps the heart pumping .
` he was out for more than 10 minutes , he 's had an amazing recovery and it 's great to see him fit and well .
