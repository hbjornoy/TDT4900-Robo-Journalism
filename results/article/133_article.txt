manchester city 's flight home from their warm-weather training trip to abu dhabi will not land until 6pm on friday -- just 21 hours before they face middlesbrough in the fa cup fourth round .
the premier league champions had the option to come back on thursday night but it is understood that manager manuel pellegrini preferred to have another training session on friday morning , before boarding the seven-hour flight at 11am uk time .
pellegrini 's side meet championship high-flyers boro in a 3pm kick-off at the etihad on saturday , and it is unusual for teams to make such a long journey so close to a match .

frank lampard -lrb- left -rrb- is expected to miss city 's fa cup home tie against middlesbrough on saturday .
but the city players will be able to go straight from manchester airport to the club 's new # 200million training base where they can stay overnight before home games and have access to state-of-the-art facilities .
frank lampard is likely to miss the tie after suffering a hip injury in the early stages of city 's friendly win over hamburg on wednesday .
but the veteran midfielder is only expected to be sidelined for a few days and should be fit to face his old club chelsea at stamford bridge a week saturday in a game that could have a crucial bearing on the title race .
