pope francis has opened a barber shop for homeless people in st peter 's square .
the state-of-the-art facility offers free haircuts , shaves and showers to rome 's down-and-outs .
the salon service , paid for by donations and the sale of papal blessings , was the idea of the pope 's chief alms-giver , monsignor konrad krajewski .
pope francis , pictured , has allowed a barber shop for the homeless of rome to open in st peter 's square .
he was moved to act after a homeless man turned down an invitation to dinner at the vatican because he was embarrassed about his smell .
yesterday -- the barber shop 's first day -- more than 40 people turned up to have their locks trimmed by volunteer stylists .
one of them , arianna corsi , said : ` we do n't want to just go over them with clippers .
` we want them to give them the full salon treatment .
if they want a high quiff or a trendy goatee we will try to make them happy .
' each ` homeless pilgrim ' received a kit including a towel , change of underwear , soap , deodorant , toothpaste , razor and shaving cream .

` the service very modern and clean , and everything is provided .
this pope is very kind .
he is not as good as john paul ii , who was our polish pope , but he is not bad at all .
' claudio , a former builder who said he had been living on the street for a year , had his hair cut for the first time since losing his job .
he greeted his new look as ` miraculous ' and said that he felt â€™20 years younger ' .
