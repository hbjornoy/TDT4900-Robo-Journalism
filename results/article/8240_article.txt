a video of two sweet-tempered twin girls locking eyes for the first time has surfaced online and it is absolutely precious .
the video begins with the two girls , called paula and alyssa , laying on their parents ' bed on their stomachs , facing each other .
propped up by body pillows , the two appear to recognise the other for the first time , before engaging in a conversation that no one else can understand , occasionally reaching out and grabbing onto each other 's hands .
their 30-year-old parents , paul and ally , admit that though life with twins can be extremely challenging , it 's moments like this that also make it very fun and rewarding .
the environment at home is all hands on deck and mum and dad are equally as involved in every aspect of the twins ' day .
` it 's a two people job , ' the couple said in an email .
` they eat at the same time , they go to sleep at the same time .
dad , paul , captured the heartwarming moment when the two realised they had a little playmate for life .
although life with twins can be difficult , their parents admit that moments like these make it all worth it .
` they copy each other , but they have very different personalities , though both love to laugh and have a great sense of humour .
' and they also have similar milestones , since they develop the same - making it that much easier for proud papa paul to capture this first-time moment on camera .
` it was so awesome to see them realising that they have a little playmate who 's just the same as them , ' the couple wrote .
` they have similar milestones , since they develop at the same time , ' the girls ' parents wrote .
the two ` lit up ' when they looked at each other , which is when dad , paul , ran for the camera and began filming .
