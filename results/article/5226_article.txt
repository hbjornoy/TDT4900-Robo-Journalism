` it 's not just focused on one player but i think gerrard is the best player i 've seen in a liverpool shirt for me .
it 's my own opinion , ' said song , who is on loan from barcelona .
' i have played against him a lot and every time i play against him , i have thought , ` today will be very hard ' .
` he has achieved a lot of things at liverpool and is still only 34 years old .
but he is still good enough to play - he can play maybe till he 's 40 .
when i see him run , he is a very good example to the young players coming through .
' i think it is very important to have those kind of loyal players who play for liverpool for a long time .
it is a very different team when gerrard is not in it .
