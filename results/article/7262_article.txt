real madrid have had a year to remember as they sit at the peak of the la liga table during the christmas break .
the spanish giants have won their last 22 consecutive games in all competitions with gareth bale chipping in with 10 goals in those encounters .
therefore many would n't be too aggrieved at the real players for wanting to take a bit of a break over the festive period ... but bale does not plan on stopping .
gareth bale took to his twitter account to post a picture of him doing some night time training on tuesday .

looking rather chilly as he posted a picture to his twitter on tuesday night , bale said : ` enjoying the christmas period , and a bit of late night training .
got to stay on this winning streak !! ' since his # 85million move from tottenham , the 25-year-old has already won four trophies in his time at the spanish club - the champions league , spanish cup , euro super cup and , this week , the club world cup .
that said , his efforts to remain on top of his game may not be fully appreciated by everybody at the bernabeu , with 54 % of fans saying they would happily see the welsh star sold to the highest bidder .
with real madrid supporters supposedly happy to let gareth bale leave if a bid of more than $ 150million was tabled , and manchester united reportedly sniffing around , maybe louis van gaal is keeping a close eye on bale 's efforts .
