police have been criticised after issuing an official tweet telling residents to trim their hedges .
cambridgeshire constabulary sent out the message from their @cambscops twitter feed saying : ` doing a bit of gardening this weekend ?
make sure your hedges are neatly trimmed , max 1m at the front and 2m at the back .
' the tweet , which has since been deleted , was branded ` utterly bizarre ' by followers .
bossy tweet : the -lrb- since deleted -rrb- tweet from cambridgeshire police advised on how to trim hedges .

twitter users were confused by the hedge-trimming directive from the police -lrb- file image -rrb- .

' and another user added : ` this tweet made me choke on my dinner laughing !

' a force spokesman defended the message , saying : ` keeping your hedges trimmed not only makes your property look well maintained , but it also shows that you 're there , which could be a deterrent .
` we are reviewing the content of the tweets for future campaigns .
' reaction : one twitter user replied to the police saying they would trim their hedges however they liked .
long arm of the lawn ?
a spokesman for cambridgeshire police said they would be checking tweets in future .
