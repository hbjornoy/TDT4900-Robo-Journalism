i 've just got back from a training camp in rio and it was such an amazing trip .
i 'd never been and had seen a lot of films about brazil and rio .
despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things , it had such a good vibe .
everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy .
at every bus stop or by the beach , almost at every point you could see , there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on .
so there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool .
i 've never seen anything like it .
it was a perfectly balanced trip for us , which was really good .
we 're just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up .
it keeps you fresh and it 's good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other .
chris mears marks his departure for rio de janeiro for a team gb diving training camp with a selfie .
mears says going to rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the uk .
without national lottery funding , we would n't be able to go out and do trips like this .
of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed , but it 's also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead .
we got a lot of serious training done and when alexei evangulov , our performance director , decided to go to rio , it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world .
to have that was a really big part of going there .
but we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there -- alexei definitely got that one right !
it was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go .
hopefully then we will all be in serious competition
