presenter : kate humble has revealed that ` crisps , air and illegal drugs ' fuelled her younger days living in london .
she 's the wholesome face of many of the bbc 's wildlife shows who seems to thrive on the great outdoors .
but kate humble has revealed that ` crisps , air and illegal drugs ' fuelled her younger days living in london .
while the former host of bbc2 's springwatch series now lives on an idyllic farm in wales , she admitted that , aged 19 , she lived in a squat .
speaking ahead of the publication of her latest book , miss humble , 44 , also defended her decision not to have any children , saying there are far too many humans on the planet already .
miss humble said : ` i do n't miss living in london .
it was exciting living in a big city when i was 19 , based in a squat and living on crisps , air and illegal drugs .
` but as i got older i realised i was knackered all the time .
` once my tv career started , i 'd go away filming to places such as africa , but at the end of the trip i would n't want to come home back to chiswick .
' miss humble went on to explain her decision not to have a family and attacked journalists for asking why she is childless .
she said : ` i was never interested in having kids .
there are far too many people in the world already .
` yet there 's still a deep suspicion in society that a woman should say , `` you know what , i never wanted them '' .
so i have to put up with journalists asking why i have n't yet had children .
` well , how do you know that i have n't had some sort of dreadful tragedy and i ca n't have them ?
' last year miss humble revealed she would no longer be part of springwatch and was replaced by michaela strachan .
