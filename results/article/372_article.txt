the phrase like shooting fish in a barrel is well known but shooting fish out of a cannon is perhaps a more unusual idea .
the washington department of fish and wildlife -lrb- wdfw -rrb- has developed the bizarre cannon to move hatchery and chinook salmon upriver in washington state .
the cannon which has been developed by whooshh innovations has been amusingly nicknamed the ` salmon cannon ' .
in a press release whooshh ceo vince bryan said the device can move the fish from the weir of the washougal river up to the riverbank with minimal handling .
although the device is called a cannon the device does not shoot fish out of it .
instead the fish are passed along the whooshh tube and once they reach the end they are put into a truck tanker which brings them to a nearby hatchery .
fast : the fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds in the whooshh tube .
wdfw personnel load the fish into the salmon cannon as they prepare to transfer them to the truck tanker .
cannon : wdfw personnel say the process of transfering the fish via the salmon is a big improvement .
the fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds when they enter the whooshh tube and it is fast and efficient .
one of the primary benefits of the whooshh tube according to wdfw hatchery reform coordinator eric kinne is that the process eliminates a large amount of stress which previously affected the fish .
mr kinne said the process of moving the fish from the centre of the river to the tanker trucks had been problematic and the new system made the process of moving the fish much easier .
speed : a fish is loaded into the salmon cannon which despite its name does not fire fish out the other end .
novel : the salmon cannon is a novel idea which has been met with a groundswell of approval by the wdfw .
success : fish enter into the truck tanker after they are transported through the whoossh tube .
