an elephant , angered by its failed attempts to break a stick in half takes its frustration out on it by flinging it at a log with its trunk .
the footage , recorded at fort worth zoo in texas , shows two elephants in an enclosure -- one clutching a stick in its trunk while swinging it about .
propping it up against a large log on the ground , the elephant lifts its leg and slowly begins to apply its weight to the centre point , hoping it will snap in two .
stopping to reposition the stick , the elephant once against tramples down upon it , but despite the mammal 's best efforts it merely slips from the log and onto the floor .
looking slightly bent although still intact , the stick is once again picked up by the elephant 's trunk and after twirling it around the mammal slams it down onto the log in a fit of rage .
meanwhile the other elephant , who appears to be eating , looks on nonchalantly .
the elephant picks up the stick , skillfully props it up against the log on the ground and begins applying its weight to the centre point in the hope of snapping it in two .
as the elephant tramples on the centre point of the stick it begins to bend but then slips down from the log .
frustrated at its failed attempts to break the stick in two the elephant picks it up in its trunk , twirls it around and throws it against the log .
youtube user johnbod , who uploaded the clip , noted that the other elephant appeared to be chewing on a piece of stick and believes that this was the reason for the elephant 's behaviour .
fort worth zoo was founded in 1909 with one lion , an alligator , a peacock , a coyote , two bear cubs and some rabbits .
today the zoo is home to 5000 native and exotic animals and features elephants in a section entitled asian falls , which was opened in 1992 .
