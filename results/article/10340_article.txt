the egg-thrower may have stolen the show , but she faced some intense competition from amanda holden .
or , more precisely , her choice of revealing outfits .
for the final the 42-year-old actress wore a plunging sequined j'anton dress .
but as she turned to whisper something to fellow judge alesha dixon the neckline slipped , exposing rather more than she might have intended to the viewers at home .
wardrobe malfunction : amanda holden revealed a little too much when she turned to the side in a plunging gown .
unfazed by the wardrobe malfunction , miss holden later changed into an even skimpier number for the show 's after-party .
grinning as she jumped from a car at the 45 park lane club in mayfair , she once again managed to be the centre of attention in the halterneck outfit , which gaped at the sides .
miss holden appeared comfortable in the short dress , which was both backless and had cutaway panels around the waist .
she was joined there by miss dixon , who went for a more low-key look by teaming skin-tight leather-look leggings and a loose-fitting orange t-shirt .
daring : the britain 's got talent judge then wore a backless , cutaway dress to the afterparty at 45 park lane .
working the cameras : the 42-year-old star seemed happy to pose in her revealing dress .
in sartorial contrast , simon cowell dressed for the live show in his usual uniform of jeans , partly buttoned white shirt and black blazer .
and he did not appear to change for the after-party -- apart from ditching his egg-spattered jacket .
saturday night 's final saw favourites attraction crowned the winners .
while disabled teen comedian jack carroll came in as runner-up .
casual co-stars : fellow judges alesha dixon -lrb- left -rrb- and simon cowell -lrb- right -rrb- wore more relaxed attire .
