a female scientist has been experimenting with beauty competitions and her results prove she 's got a formula for success .
alice ford , 21 , spends her days in a white coat studying for her degree in molecular biology but in her spare time she gets dressed up to walk down the catwalk at beauty pageants .
so successful is alice that she has beaten 40 other girls to win the coveted title of miss wales and a shot at the miss world contest later this year .
beauty and brains !
alice ford , a 21-year-old molecular biology student , has been crowned miss wales and is hoping to win the miss world crown when she competes later this year .
speaking about her passion for her studies , alice said : ` my first love is genetics and the theory behind it .
i 'm hoping to go into medical research as that 's what i 'm really fascinated in .
` but i was encouraged to enter a beauty contest and i loved it because its so different to life in the laboratory .
` to win the miss wales title is a thrill - i am enjoying every minute of it .
` my friends are so proud of me - they keep asking me to wear my sash when i 'm out with them .
' alice first started taking part in beauty pageants while studying for her a-levels in her home city of cardiff .
best of both worlds : alice says genetics is her one true love but believes that with the right time management , she can balance her studies with modelling .
she turned down a modelling contract to concentrate on her studies at cardiff university , where she is in her second year .
her ambition is to be at the forefront of medical research into new drugs to tackle some of the world 's most deadly diseases .
but for now she has the miss world final , being held in london in september , in her sights .
she said : ` people think it 's a bit strange when they find out my passion is molecular biology .
