a girl battling cancer has been fitted with metal bones which will grow as she does .
lily willis , 8 , from great lumley , county durham , was diagnosed with a bone cancer tumour called osteosarcoma in february after she came home from school limping just weeks earlier .
the tumour , on her right leg , meant that her entire knee , tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones .
as lily grows , a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required .
lily willis holds an x-ray of her leg , which shows her new metal bones that will grow with her over the next six years .
her mother tori , 30 , said : ` lily came home after school one day with a sore ankle .
she had been doing cross-country and was limping .
we thought nothing of it and imagined she had just sprained it while she had been out running .
` but after a couple of weeks , the pain had travelled up her leg and did n't seem to be going anywhere so i took her to the doctors .
' i thought they were just going to strap her up and send her home again - we never thought it would ever be anything serious .
' but tori and lily 's father bryan were in for the shock of their lives after doctors sent lily for an x-ray , which revealed she had a tumour on the bone above her right knee .
bryan , 40 , said : ` they did an x-ray of her ankle and then called us back so they could do another on her hips .
` we were told to wait five days and assumed this meant there was nothing serious going on or they would have done something straight away .
` but the hospital called us a few days later and told us we had to take lily out of school and get her there .
` that 's when we started to worry .
