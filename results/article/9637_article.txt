chris mumme owns the butcher on darling street less than 100 metres from where a convenience store went up in flames on thursday morning .
lucky is not a word many would use to describe a situation where one has lost everything but their life .
but those who survived a tragic fire which caused the death of three locals believe they are just that .
chris mumme , who owns the butcher on darling street , balmain - just a few shops down from the rubble where a convenience store once stood - has not been able to access his shop nor his flat above since the blaze on thursday .
he has lost thousands of dollars worth of meat as his store has been left without power since the explosion .
however , he considers himself one of the more fortunate ones in this devastating event .
` it 's really insignificant compared to what other people have had happened , i 've lost my livelihood and my meat but i 'm alive .
i 'm lucky ' , chris told daily mail australia .
he told of the toll the tragedy , in which bianka o'brien , 31 , her 12-month-old son jude , and another man chris noble , 27 , were killed in had on the local community .
the convenience store 's owner adeel khan , 44 , was pulled from the rubble early on thursday and taken to hospital along with two other men who jumped from the apartments above .
` everyone 's in tears every five minutes , it 's so overwhelming , ' he revealed .
despite this , locals have banded together in a show of strength and solidarity and chris said it 's as though the suburb in sydney 's inner west is a ` country town ' .
` we 're pretty strong , we get knocked down we get up again , we 've got no choice ' .
` we 're all the lucky ones in the context of it all but at the end of the day everyone 's affected in different ways , and everyone has different coping mechanisms , ' chris added .
a woman who lived next door to the convenience store which went up in flames in the early hours of thursday morning also told of how blessed she felt
