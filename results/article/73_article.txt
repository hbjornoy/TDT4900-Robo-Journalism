lewis bojang is a dead ringer for will.i.am , and is frequently mistaken for the hip hop black eyed peas star .
` people in shops , restaurants clubs and bars have asked me to have a picture taken with them .
' it was his wife karen , 38 , an office manager , who first spotted the resemblance as the couple watched the voice .
' i looked at will.i.am on the television and then looked across at lewis and something suddenly clicked , ' she said .
lewis 's wife karen bevins noticed the likeness while the couple were watching an episode of the voice .
' i ca n't believe we did n't notice it sooner but we never really followed will.i.am or were interested in his music .
` for about a year now people have commented wherever we go and give lewis a second look and even the vip treatment .
` people do double takes or ask if he is related and his friends even call him will now .
` we 've had shop staff scurrying round and holding open doors for us before they realise there are no paparazzi or bodyguards .
' the couple are to attend the live show of the voice this summer and hope to meet will.i.am backstage .
' ' i have always dressed similar to will.i.am 's style anyway but now i have i started buying more similar clothes , ' said lewis .
