tall tale : this as yet unnamed rothchild giraffe was born in less than two hours at woburn safari park .
mum 's the word : the new-born was just a few hours old when these pictures were taken with proud mother frankie keeping careful watch .
while fully grown giraffes have few predators in the wild , their young are preyed upon by lions , hyenas and leopards .
the calf , which was born to mother frankie and father casper , has not yet been named .
it was frankie 's third calf , and she will spend the next 13 months weaning her .
once she has found her feet , she will have the freedom to roam a seven-acre section of the park along with the rest of the herd , which they share with grevy 's zebra and scimitar horned oryx .
she will spend the rest of the warm .
summer months sleeping outside , but will be spared britain 's bitter .
winter months when she and the rest of the herd are brought in at night .
overseeing her young : fully grown giraffes have .
few predators in the wild , but calves can be hunted by big cats , such as .
lions and leopards , as well as packs of hyenas .
although the new giraffe is only a snip at the moment , when she is fully .
grown he will stand a proud 20ft tall -lrb- 6m -rrb- and will live to about 20 .
years old .
woburn spokeswoman dawn jones said : ` she was born naturally yesterday at 2.40 pm in the paddock .
everyone here is delighted .
` she 's already 6ft tall
