five tests between an england team who have forgotten how to win and an indian one usually only victorious at home will decide the captaincy fate of alastair cook over the next six , highly-congested weeks .
crunch time for a captain under intense pressure arrives in the form of one of the most condensed five-test series of all time that begins today at a trent bridge ground where england normally swing their way to victory .
certainly , in just 42 days at the kia oval it will be known whether cook has come through the biggest test yet of his undoubted strength and remains the man to lead england in their attempt to win back the ashes next summer .

under pressure : england captain alastair cook with coach peter moores .
in need of runs : cook knows he has been failing with the bat .
preparing : the captain knows that he needs runs and wins to save his role .
judgment on cook may come sooner if england , without a win in eight tests , suffer a repeat of their nottingham defeat in the 2007 ` jelly bean ' test against india , or at a lord 's ground next week where they could not get past sri lanka .
cook is nothing if not a fighter and there was a quiet determination about him yesterday , as he weighed up a series that has assumed exaggerated importance through england 's failure to beat the sri lankans in all formats .
` until the day the selectors decide i 'm not the right man for the job , i will continue to do it , ' said cook , when asked if his captaincy could survive a series defeat by an indian team who have gone 14 tests without an away win -- stretching back to before they were hammered 4-0 by england three years ago .
` it is a huge honour to do this and i can sleep knowing i throw everything i 've got into it .
` i 'm not in charge of when i go and i will continue to concentrate on the job i was asked to do .
i 'm incredibly proud to be england captain .
