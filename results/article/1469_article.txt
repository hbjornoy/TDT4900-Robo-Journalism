the best thing about the 19 wickets moeen ali has picked up in four tests against india is the speed with which he has improved .
no newcomer to test cricket already has the perfect game , otherwise they 'd have been picked years ago .
it 's why we need to give a bit more leeway to the likes of chris woakes and chris jordan .
of course there 's a gap between them and the experienced new-ball pairing of jimmy anderson and stuart broad .
that 's how it works !
but what is so exciting about moeen is that he has taken on board some of the criticisms of the way he was bowling in the first half of the summer , and now looks much more settled at test level .

a lot has been made of the chat he had with ian bell during a practice session before the third test at the ageas bowl -- and rightly so .
bell basically told him he felt moeen was bowling in test matches like he was in the nets , mixing up his variations and not finding a consistent pace .
he suggested moeen bowl a little more quickly out in the middle , and that seems to have made a lot of difference .
we saw on saturday in manchester , for example , that mooen is now harder to get down the pitch to because the ball is arriving that little bit earlier ; when ms dhoni tried to hit him over the top , he ended up dragging one to midwicket .
moeen 's gone from bowling around 50mph at the start of the season to over 55mph .
it 's been a crucial change of gear .
but it 's one thing to listen to a piece of advice -- it 's another to implement it successfully .
it shows the lad has a great capacity to learn and improve , as well as all the elements you need to be a good off-spinner ; he spins the ball , he gets drift and he can beat the bat on both sides .
