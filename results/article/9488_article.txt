aruba sounded familiar .
could this be anything to do with the beach boys ' jingly song kokomo , where the island 's name is sung in the chorus .
you know how it goes : ` aruba , jamaica , ooh i wan na take ya ... ' as it was , we would be hearing this tune many times on this fascinating caribbean island .
aruba is a dutch protectorate .
once part of a group of three islands that fell under dutch rule -lrb- curacao and bonaire are the others -rrb- , it has been independent since 1986 .
from the moment you touch down at queen beatrix airport , you sense there something special is going on .
home for the week : enjoying the sunset at the bucuti & tara beach resort in aruba .
yes , it has white-sand beaches and clear , blue waters packed to the brim with every fish you could hope to see and of course the bars ooze rum punch .
but there 's also the grandeur of the architecture in the capital , oranjestad .
the bucuti & tara beach resort is a low-lying hotel on the quiet eagle beach , on the western coast .
it is adults only .
our room was simple , though luxurious , all dark-wood furniture and linens .
it overlooked a pretty garden , the lawns stretching out to the beach half a minute 's walk away .
the capital city of oranjestad is home to many grand dutch-style buildings in a myriad of beautiful colours .
on our first day , we headed inland to explore some rock formations thought to have healing powers .
my wife rose swore she felt a tingle , touching the rocks .
then we adjourned for lunch with local fishermen at the zee rover , a cafe perched above the landing stage for their boats .
we decided next day that we would take a snorkelling tour boat to get a close look at a wreck .
tickled pink : flamingos are easy to spot on renaissance island in aruba .
it was something neither rose nor i had ever done before and we set off in a packed boat for the site , which was about a third of a mile from the shore .
we spied some elegant flamingos on the way
