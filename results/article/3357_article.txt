diagnosis : julie dawson -lrb- with partner andy -rrb- was diagnosed with melanoma after years of sun worshipping .
medics saved her life by cutting out a massive chunk of her right limb in a bid to completely remove all traces of the malignant melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer .
she has been left with a large hole on her leg , leaving her too shy to wear swimwear , shorts or dresses .
ms dawson , an office administrator from consett , co durham , said : ' i used to love shorts and dresses , but now i never wear them .
` my vanity to be tanned almost cost me my life , and it 's certainly knocked my confidence .
' i hate my scar .
whenever anyone notices it , i tell them i 've been bitten by a shark , but there are n't many sharks round here .

cancer : she first noticed a suspicious-looking mole on her right calf in 2007 , which grew to the size of two one-pound coins stacked on top of each other .
she had the operation to remove the huge cancerous growth the following year , which left her with a large palm-sized gash on her leg .
she added : ` when i was a kid , we 'd always be out playing with no suncream on .
` and then when i got older , we 'd be out sitting in the pubs .
i always had my legs out , but never bothered putting suncream on .
' i suppose i 've only got myself to blame really , especially because i used to go on sunbeds a couple of times
