the number of people abandoning russia has shot up to its highest level in 15 years .
more than 200,000 russians emigrated in the first eight months of this year - continuing a ` brain drain ' which has been apparent since vladimir putin was re-elected as president in 2012 .
it has caused shockwaves among analysts because until then , the number of people leaving russia had been declining for 20 years following the collapse of the soviet union .
