earlier this year , jobless mother of 11 heather frost caused outrage when it was revealed that she would be moving into a taxpayer-funded # 500,000 home with her brood .
but although the resulting furore cost her the house , frost , who appears in new channel 5 documentary on benefits and proud , is unrepentant .
in the film , the foul-mouthed 37-year-old from gloucestershire is seen telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned , her view is ` f *** the lot of them .
' unrepentant : heather frost with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer funded six-bedroom home .
outspoken : in the aftermath of the controversy , frost appeared on good morning to defend herself .
` it 's a f *** ing s **** y council house , ' she adds .
` everyone wants to believe what they read in the f *** ing papers do n't .
they .
` every child needs a house , a roof over their head i should say , .
do n't they ?
it .
was n't our choice for the council to build a new house , it was theirs .
` no one 's put a gun to their f *** ing head .
i think they -lsb- other people -rsb- .
are jealous .
f *** the lot of them !
everyone 's entitled to their opinion .
but everyone 's entitled to a place to live .
' frost , who receives benefits totalling # 900 per week - the same as someone who earns # 60,000 a year - is now looking forward to a council-funded renovation of her current home , which will see the two three-bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to create a permanent six-bedroom house .
the cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds , and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms .
but despite the vast expense to taxpayers , who spend a staggering # 100 million on benefits every day according to government figures , frost , who has never had a full time job , says the system is put there to help people like
