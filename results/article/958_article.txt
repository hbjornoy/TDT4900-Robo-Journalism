fourteen british troops are being investigated over the death of an iraqi civilian on board a uk helicopter taking part in a top-secret mission .
tariq sabri was carried unconscious from the chinook aircraft and pronounced dead hours later on april 11 , 2003 .
at the time he was being transported between what are described as ` illegal prisons ' in the iraq desert .
the police investigation into sabri Â¿ s death comes just days after the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- launched a ` preliminary examination ' into the alleged torture of iraqi prisoners by uk troops .
sabri , an odd-job man , was buried without a post-mortem , making it hard to establish a cause of death .
now , the mail on sunday has been told how he made a lunge for british airmen aboard the helicopter and was knelt on for the remainder of the flight .
the troops being questioned come from the raf regiment which last week was at the centre of a row over photos apparently showing airmen posing next to the dead bodies of taliban fighters in afghanistan .
