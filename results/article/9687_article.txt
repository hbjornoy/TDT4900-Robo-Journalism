we are in tony bennett 's painting studio overlooking new york 's central park .
there 's a table full of oil paints , half-finished canvases , watercolours .
a bronze bust of harry belafonte .
tony bennett is not a person who paints in old slacks and a cardigan .
he 's wearing a navy pin-stripe suit , blue shirt , floral tie and a smile that is part angelic , part cheery cheshire cat .
his eyes are large and kind , but you feel there is pain behind them .
tony bennett describes amy winehouse as ` one of the greatest jazz singers of all time ' he 's 87 , still singing , still painting , still taking art classes , still headlining concert tours and putting out at least two albums a year .
his latest , the classics , is a collection of his most loved duets .
they include sinatra , streisand , stevie wonder , lady gaga , christina aguilera and michael bubl√© .
poignantly , too , there 's a reprise of his 2011 grammy-winner body and soul with the talented but tragic amy winehouse , her last-ever track , recorded just a few months before her death in july that year .
they developed an unlikely bond .
` amy winehouse was one of the greatest jazz singers of all time , ' he tells me , gesturing for me to sit with him on his couch .
` in many ways she achieved what she wanted to do .
it 's regrettable that she died so young .
' long pause .
` she was wonderful .
' did she ever talk to him about her problems or her addiction to drugs and alcohol ?
there 's another long pause .
' i wanted her to ... ' he begins .
` cary grant , the handsomest man in the world , sorry for name-dropping , suggested before he died -lrb- in 1986 -rrb- that for my 85th birthday i should play the london palladium .
' when he reached his 80s , bennett began making plans for the palladium show and wanted amy to play there with him .
' i was so sad she died before i had the chance to ask her , ' he says .
