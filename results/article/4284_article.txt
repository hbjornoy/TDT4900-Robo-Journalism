a pc who made a false police report that his iphone had been stolen was caught after he used it to call his girlfriend .
pc gareth beard , 35 , wanted a new iphone so pretended his had been snatched in a mcdonald 's and created a bogus crime report to back up his fictitious claims .
but the bungling policeman , who worked for the met , was rumbled when the phone was used to call his girlfriend and home number after he reported it stolen in april 2010 .
gareth beard was found guilty of reporting his mobile stolen to claim for a new one on his insurance .
beard denied fraud but was convicted following a trial at southwark crown court .
he was spared jail today after nicholas yeo , defending , urged a judge to give him a suspended sentence and said beard had repaid o2 the # 489 he conned them out of .
judge david higgins told him what he had done was ` deplorable ' and ` deeply antisocial .
' he added it ` greatly undermined ' the confidence and trust the public placed in the police force .
but he said a six-month jail term fitted the crime and was satisfied he could suspend this for two years as it was beard 's first offence .
beard will also be tagged , be the subject of a curfew between 8pm and 7am and pay court costs of # 1,000 .
the judge warned him : ` if you commit any further crime while this sentence is suspended you will be brought back before me and i will sent you straight to prison .
no mitigation will save you .
' asked if he understood beard answered : ` yes , your honour .
' the officer lied because he wanted a new apple iphone .
sentencing him , judge higgins said : ` your motive for this offence , which in my judgment can only be pre-meditated , was to secure a new phone worth between # 400 and # 500 through the medium of the company which insurance the allegedly stolen telephone .
` this was an insurance fraud , albeit
