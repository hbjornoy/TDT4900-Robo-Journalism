athletic bilbao have waited 16 long years to get back into the champions league and when their big moment finally came , they got stage fright .
the basque side had the better of the game against shakhtar donetsk but were too worried about their opponents counter-attacking potential to commit as many men forward as they usually do at the san mames .
perhaps wary of basque rivals real sociedad 's 2-0 defeat by shakhtar at anoeta last season , athletic seemed to play a tighter game than normal , lacking the drive and thrust we have come to see them employ .

athletic 's supporters , however , were in no mood to let the evening drift by .
generally considered the most passionate fans in the country , they were in good voice as their team got their first champions league campaign since 1998 underway .
