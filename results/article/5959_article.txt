rbs has apologised for misleading a parliamentary committee over its treatment of small businesses .
the row over the bank 's treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises , or smes , is the latest in a series of scandals for rbs since it was bailed out by the government in the financial crisis .
deputy chief executive chris sullivan and derek sach , head of the grg unit , were summoned by the committee in june to discuss claims that it destroyed small firms for profit .
they flatly denied that grg , which is now being shut down , was a ` profit centre ' .
sir philip hampton , chairman of rbs , insisted they made an ` honest mistake ' when discussing the controversial global restructuring group before the treasury select committee .
but mr sullivan later wrote to mr tyrie to clarify -- and sir philip has now admitted the initial evidence was wrong .
` the evidence the bank 's representatives provided was not correct , ' he said in a letter to mr tyrie on august 22 , made public yesterday .
he added that the men ` did not intend to mislead ' .
mr tyrie said : ` it was materially incorrect on a crucial point and unacceptable .
rbs has done the right thing and apologised .
' labour mp john mann said : ` how much more is there to come ?
this is a bank the state owns , having bailed them out , and we are still getting misled .
' a spokesman for rbs said : ` the bank has apologised unreservedly for any confusion caused .
this was not intentional .
