former chelsea midfielder claude makélélé is to leave his position as psg 's assistant manager in order to become the new head coach at ligue 1 side bastia .
makélélé , who played for real madrid , chelsea and psg during his illustrious career could be presented as the new bastia boss before the end of the week according to french daily paper l'equipe .
psg offered makélélé a two year extension to his current deal but he turned it down in order to take up a full-time role in the hot seat .
he could be joined by former france team-mate willy sagnol in becoming a ligue 1 boss with the former bayern munich defender close to being appointed as the new manager of bordeaux .
action : claude makelele playing for chelsea against liverpool in the champions league semi-final in 2008 .
international : makelele lining up for france in 2007 for one of his 71 national caps .
makélélé , 41 , was an integral part of jose mourinho 's early success at stamford bridge and his cult status saw a position ` the makélélé role ' named after him .
signed from real madrid in 2003 makélélé was the crucial anchor in mourinho 's 4-3-3 , allowing the likes of frank lampard to get further forward .
psg won a league and coupe de ligue double this season under blanc and makélélé whilst bastia beat the odds to achieve an impressive 10th place finish .
the reports suggest that the corsican club have been in contact with makélélé for over a week , as they look for a replacement for frederic hantz who resigned at the end of last season .
hero : makelele was a legend at stamford bridge where he won two league titles .
rejected : despite league success makelele chose to leave his position as laurent blanc 's assistant .
