tax collectors are targeting thousands of people who have sold a second home , a holiday home or a buy-to-let property without paying tax , even if it was up to 20 years ago .
if they fail to do so , they could face huge fines and even jail under the new plans .
the move will give rise to accusations that hmrc is penalising ordinary , hard-working families when they should be tackling tax avoidance by corporate giants who make huge profits but pay little or no tax in this country .
under the current rules , you are allowed to sell your home without paying a penny in tax , but the rules are different if you own more than one property .
for example , a family with their main home in london and a cottage on the cornish coast must pay capital gains tax on any profit from the sale of their country retreat .
under the tax amnesty , hmrc is urging people who should have paid tax - but failed to do so - to come forward over the next five months .
the deadline is august 9 .
if they do not , they could face penalties worth up to 100 per cent of the capital gains tax bill which they did not pay on the sale on top of the actual bill .
