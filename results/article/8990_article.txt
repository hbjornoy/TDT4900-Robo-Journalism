beautiful shoes are the foundation of any fashionable woman 's wardrobe , and as the editor of american vogue , anna wintour has access to more stylish skyscraper heels than she could ever wear .
so why , then , has the legendary fashion editor insisted on wearing the same pair of nude , pointy-toed slingbacks not just to every london fashion week show she has attended over the past few days , but almost everywhere she has been since 1994 , when they were first made-to-measure for the editor by manolo blahnik himself ?
blahnik showed his shoes at london fashion week for the first time this monday , when he revealed his reason for doing so : ' i wanted to get more in touch with normal people .
' it 's shoe time !

right : same shoes , same day - different dress .
june 1999 : an early sighting of the shoes .
october 2003 : milan fashion week .
july 2004 : jean paul gaultier fashion show .
april 2005 : out shopping in new york .
september 2006 : fashion rocks concert .
june 2006 : at a fundraising event .
his shoes are not the most expensive out there , but still hover around # 500 a pair , so the idea that he is connecting with ` normal ' is slightly moot .
more importantly , he unveiled his shoes for next spring : they come in a riot of colours , from daffodil yellow to sugary pink , acid green and scarlet , and are adorned with tassels , bows , silver buckles , gold brocade , cream embroidery , zebra spots , florals ... all of which seemed infinitely more exciting than the nude pair , which have two intersecting straps over the front of the foot , that anna wintour seems to have had surgically attached to her tootsies .
september 2007 : calvin klein show .
