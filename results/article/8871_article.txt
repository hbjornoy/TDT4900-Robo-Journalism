horrendous : chinese teenager zhou yan shows the horrific burns she suffered after she was doused in petrol and set alight because she spurned the advances of a classmate .
a chinese teenager suffered horrific burns to her face after she was doused in petrol and set alight because she spurned the advances of a classmate .
zhou yan , 17 , had been flattered when tao rukun , also 17 and the son of a wealthy and well-connected family , had asked her out for a date .
but when she decided he was too arrogant , and told him to leave her alone , she said he had become aggressive and threatening .
her worried parents had moved her to a new school , but instead of being put off tao pestered her at her home , and after asking to speak to her in private in her room last september , doused her in petrol and set her on fire .
he then stood by as she screamed and her terrified grandmother tried to put out the blaze that left her horrifically burned over 30 per cent of her body , particularly around her head , neck and chest .
despite the pain , her ordeal was not over as her parents could not afford the medical bills , and were reliant on her attacker 's family to pay the cost .
tao 's parents were local government officials .
tao 's father works for hefei urban planning bureau and his mother is with hefei audit bureau .
but when she refused to sign a statement saying it had been an accident , the payments suddenly stopped , and she ended up back at home .
her parents said : ` we did not even have the money to properly repair her room that had been damaged by the fire .
' it seemed as if tao would get away with the attack - until her dad posted a picture of his girl before and after on the internet .
it went viral , and put massive pressure on local officials to reopen the case .
