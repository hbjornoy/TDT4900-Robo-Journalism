britons are spending more time listening to their radios , but younger listeners are turning off in favour of the internet .
although over-35s continue to tune into their favourite shows , radio is falling out of favour with those in their teens and early 20s .
a study by media regulator ofcom found that last year britons listened to an average 22.5 hours of radio each week -- an increase of 24 minutes on 2010 .
tuning in : a study by media regulator ofcom found that last year britons listened to an average 22.5 hours of radio each week Â¿ an increase of 24 minutes on 2010 .
however , the medium was less popular with younger people , with those aged 15 to 24 listening to only 17 hours a week -- a fall of 22 per cent in ten years .
similarly 25 to 34-year-olds tuned in for only 19.3 hours last year compared with 22.7 in 2001 .
ofcom said the reason was down to young people using music sharing websites such as spotify and soundcloud , and the increase in mp3 music players , such as ipods , which can hold thousands of songs on one device .
radio accounted for 82 per cent of the time adults spent listening to audio material , compared with only 56 per cent for those in their late teens .
the success of radio 4 could also be part of the reason that older listeners are still tuning in , the research suggested .
the station recorded listening figures of around 11million a week last year , while its flagship show the today programme , which is fronted by john humphrys , almost overtook chris moyles 's radio 1 breakfast show , aimed at listeners in their late teens .

apple 's itunes and video-sharing site youtube are also changing the way people listen to music .
