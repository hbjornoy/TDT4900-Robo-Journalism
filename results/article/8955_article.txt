at the age of just 28 , carly perkins is facing the fact she has a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer as she is a carrier of the deadly brca1 gene .
now carly , from crawley , has taken the brave decision to have a double mastectomy this month to reduce her chances of one day developing the disease .
the young mother told the mailonline her decision to have surgery was a ` no brainer ' but her ordeal has been helped thanks to michelle heaton going through the same procedure .
cancer risk : carly perkins , pictured with her daughter tilly , is a carrier of the deadly brca1 gene .
she said : ` michelle heaton has been a role model for me to look up to .
there 's not much support for people my age going through this but she has brought it into the public eye .
as she has been so open about what she 's been through , it has made me feel like i can be more open too .
` before some of my friends did n't understand why i was having my breasts removed when i do n't actually have cancer .
now it 's easier to say , ' i have what michelle heaton has , ' and they understand .
michelle , 33 , had a double mastectomy last year after discovering she was a carrier of the brca2 gene .
the gene means carriers have an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and a 60 .
per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer in her lifetime .
she said at the time she was under-going the operation for the sake of her daughter , faith , 14 months .
putting the condition in the public eye : carly said it has helped her seeing another young mother , singer michelle heaton , pictured with daughter faith , going through the same thing .
` as a mum you never want to anticipate leaving your child .
without a mum .
the whole point of this was to get the dark cloud away .
from my head and to get on with life
