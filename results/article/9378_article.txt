an indianapolis jail let an inmate out by mistake last week - the sixth time such an error has occurred since june .
it took marion county deputies three days to locate and rearrest scott snyder , 31 , who was in jail for assault with a deadly weapon .
in june , deputies had to track down five inmates who had been released by accident .
assault with a deadly weapon : scott snyder was released mistakenly and free for three days before deputies tracked him down .
fox 59 reports that the problems began when the county switched over to a new computer system called odyssey in june .
a spokesperson said the latest mistaken release was down to the system and human error .
sheriff of the year : despite the accolades , sheriff john layton has been hindered by errors that have seen criminals released by mistake .
according to the indystar , the error occurred when a release order was logged on snyder 's case file but the jail staff did n't check a second case file number for the prisoner , which said snyder should be held in custody .
snyder was released monday and back in custody thursday .
` they 're human beings and there can be human errors , it 's not a totally electronic system and even with the information that they have it 's extremely complicated , ' said lieutenant colonel louis dezelan .
following the earlier incident , he said the sheriff 's department would go ` above and beyond ' to ensure it did n't happen again .
sheriff john layton , a democrat , was just named indiana sheriff of the year and will run against republican emmitt carney in november .
carney says layton should bear the blame for the mistakes .
` they can say it 's on the computer , they can say it 's operator error , bottom line it comes down to him .
it 's his office , it 's his shop .
when is somebody going to step up and accept responsibility , ' carney told fox59 .
