a woman is suing a hospital where surgeons left a four-inch plastic tube inside her , resulting in her losing half a lung when it was removed .
julie jones , 51 , underwent surgery to have her spleen removed in october 2009 and thought she had made a full recovery .
but she claims doctors at st james ' university hospital , in leeds , had left a tube inside her lung which threatened to kill her at any moment if it pierced her liver .
julie jones claims surgeons left a tube inside her lung during surgery to remove her spleen .
the problem was only spotted when ms jones , who moved from leeds to devon in 2011 , began to feel seriously unwell and went to hospital for a scan and chest x-ray .
staff at the royal devon and exeter hospital immediately detected the tube and advised a non-invasive operation to try and remove it .
but after six failed attempts they decided to operate and take out half of her lung , leaving the mother-of-four disabled .
ms jones said : ` when the doctor told me that i would have to have part of my lung removed i asked him what exactly the `` foreign body '' was .
` the doctor just told me i 'd been horribly let down on my last operation and showed me the x-ray of my chest .
` when i saw the tube in my lung i was immediately sick , i could n't even eat anything for three days because i was so repulsed .
after six failed attempts to remove the tube , surgeons were forced to take out half of her lung , leaving the mother-of-four disabled .
ms jones said : ` the surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver .
at any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it , killing me ' ` how on earth could a team of ten surgeons have missed a four-inch plastic tube with shiny metal clips - it 's terrifying and disgusting .
' she added : ` the surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver .
` at any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it , killing me
