a player for the jacksonville jaguars walked away from a play sunday afternoon with more than a successful tackle when he managed to get a fistful of his opponent 's hair .
during the jacksonville home game against arizona , a cardinals running back was slammed after a short run by defensive end jason babin .
and when babin emerged from the pile , he held a fat fistful of andre ellington 's dreadlocks .
hair raising !
jacksonville jaguars defender jason babin came out of a pileup in a sunday game against the arizona cardinals with a fistful of hair .
babin , 33 , held the hair aloft for a moment like a trophy .
then , perhaps realizing that hair does n't bronze well , defiantly chucked it all to the ground .
the hair-raising tackle has occurred in the past -- to such tress-sporting players as troy polamalu -- but not in recent memory has the player lost the hair .
ouch : andre ellington , a cardinals running back -lrb- pictured here during his years at clemson -rrb- is now short several dreadlocks .
write caption here .
limp victory : after the pride subsided , or perhaps after he realized hair does n't make a great trophy , babin tossed the locks to the ground .
now 24-year-old ellington has little to be do short of waiting for it to grow back .
he wore his hair outside his helmet at his own peril .
according to nfl rules , yanking exposed hair is fair play .
the rule , implemented in 2003 , says that it is legal to grab a player 's hair because it 's deemed part of the uniform .
ellinton may have gotten the last laugh , though .
his arizona cardinals trounced babin 's jaguars 27-14 .
cold comfort : ellington can do little but lick his wounds and wait for his hair to grow back .
since 2003 , hair has been deemed ` part of the uniform ' and legal to pull in a tackle .
his cardinals beat babin 's jaguars , however , 24 to 14 .
