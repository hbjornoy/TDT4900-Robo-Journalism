night shift employees often need to find creative ways of filling their time .
but workers at a french supermarket have certainly found one of the most creative ways of filling their time while they were meant to be filling shelves .
arranging pallets and products into a behemoth domino chain , viewers are taken on a tour through the store by way of the domino effect .
filmed by eric bourde , the chain begins outside the rennes store of belgian supermarket chain cora .
a worker pushes the first wooden pallet , at the automatic door entrance of a burgundy shopping centre - kicking off the impressive domino chain that diverges and meets again after going around a tree .
stack 'em up : the domino chain started with wooden pallets that led to the normandy supermarket 's entrance .
up and away : the products ranged in size and shape .
as the domino chain reaches the supermarket aisles , the dominos become the products that customers would find in each aisle if they were shopping there .
from dvds and cds to tetra-paks of juice and tissue boxes , nothing is off limits in the massive domino effect of supermarket products .
aisle be watching !
the impressive domino chain went from aisle to aisle .
everything but the kitchen sink : as the domino chain made it 's way through the aisles , the different products available to shoppers were showcased .
eventually , the chain ends at the checkout and a young female employee is seen holding a sign , that translates in english to ` thank you for your visit ' .
some viewers of the video have branded it a marketing stunt , but either way - it will no doubt serve as inspiration for bored supermarket workers everywhere .
