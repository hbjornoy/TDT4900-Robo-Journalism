chris soteriou was in a coma for 10 days following the attack in melbourne on january 2 , 2010 , which was orchestrated by his wife of 18 years , vicky soterious .
chris still bares the horrific scars after his wife had organised for her lover , ari dimitrakis , to stab him as they walked from a greek restaurant in fitzroy to their car 500m away after his 44th birthday party .
` it sends shivers down my spine that the person you loved and treasured organised to kill you , ' chris told channel 7 's sunday night .
soterious had preemptively parked the couple 's car in a dimly lit street and had organised for her lover to attack when they returned from the restaurant late that night .
despite going missing for 30 minutes during dinner so she could show dimitrakis where the car was parked , chris had no reason to suspect what the mother of their three children had planned .
as the couple approached the car , chris said he saw a man crouching down and his wife broke away and went to stand in the middle of the street .
it was then dimitrakis ` slit my throat ' .
` there was no feeling .
i did n't feel any pain , i just it was more shock .
i just felt the blood run down my chest and felt this warm , warm fluid running down my body , ' he said .
cctv cameras captured the couple walking back to their car just minutes before chris was attacked .
` i remember saying if i do n't make it just look after the kids
