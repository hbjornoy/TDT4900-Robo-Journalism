testing : a harrods customer tests the store 's cherries - some of the first to be grown outside this year .
everybody wants a bite of the cherry ... but you 'll need deep pockets to do so -- as harrods has opened this year 's season for the fruit by selling them at a juicy # 1.65 each .
at the upmarket store in knightsbridge , west london , the mail on sunday paid # 41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g -lrb- 10.5 oz -rrb- and contained just 25 cherries .
at # 140 a kilo -lrb- or # 64/lb -rrb- , industry sources said this was a ` record ' price for early-season cherries .
the fruit is not available at all until april , when the only supply in the world comes from heated spanish greenhouses .
but the harrods cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors .
bruce langlands , the store 's director of foods , said : ` we sell french glamour edoa cherries from a small producer in the pyrenees with a limited number of trees .
` they grow in the open and are only available for four weeks in the year .
each cherry is hand-picked at optimal ripeness with direct , same-day distribution into harrods .
` the producer only supplies harrods with this variety .
as these cherries are very difficult to grow , very few people do .
because they are so rare , they are expensive .
' but even more common varieties of cherry might plunge the average family budget into the red .
at marks & spencer on friday , a 200g -lrb- 7oz -rrb- pack of cherries cost # 5 .
with 20 cherries in the pack each cherry worked out at 25p .
a marks & spencer spokeswoman said : ` it 's early for the cherry season but demand is outstripping supply and that is why shoppers are having to pay these prices .
` next week though the season comes into full swing , cherries will be in abundance and prices will come down .
' morrisons cherries will also be on .
promotion from tomorrow , with a 10oz punnet priced # 2 -- almost 20 times .
cheaper than harrods ' variety .
stone me !
