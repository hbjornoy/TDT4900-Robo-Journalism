timothy jarvis , 18 , was just days into starting a maths degree at the university of essex when the tragic accident occurred .
a mother condemned the ` dangerous culture ' of freshers ' week binge-drinking yesterday after her student son died in a drunken fall .
timothy jarvis , 18 , was in the first week of his maths degree when he downed an entire bottle of rum in 15 minutes for a bet .
the former grammar school boy then suffered fatal head injuries after tumbling down a flight of stairs at his university 's hall of residence .
despite being taken to hospital , it was 90 minutes before he was assessed by a doctor and he died the next day .
his grieving mother marina , 54 , said : ` i do n't see the point of freshers ' week at all and i think it should be banned .
` they think they are adults , but they are not -- they have left the nest but they are still children .
` they are there to study , not drink , and this tradition of cheap drinks and getting drunk is a very dangerous culture .
` suddenly this antisocial binge-drinking is only acceptable because it 's happening at university where the young intelligentsia are .
` it is truly tragic what happened to our son , but this could happen to all parents with children at university .
' mr jarvis , from orpington , kent , won a place at essex university last year after achieving four good a levels at st olave 's grammar school .
his inquest heard the popular musician had made a bet with friends on his corridor that he could drink a bottle of rum in half an hour .
fellow student dimitris vachaviolos , 19 , said : ` tim was drinking a bottle of rum and my friend had a stopwatch going .
it was just a game .
` he had a bet that he could drink a bottle of rum in 30 minutes .
he did it .
he drunk it in 15 minutes , actually .
' mr vachaviolos said he helped mr jarvis downstairs and out of the hall of residence , where he was sick , before he tried to help him up to bed .
