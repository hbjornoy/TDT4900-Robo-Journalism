crystal palace ended their pre-season tour of the united states unbeaten with a resounding 3-0 defeat of the richmond kickers at city stadium in richmond , virginia .
the kickers , who play in the lower leagues of us soccer , were no match for a strong palace side that will now head back to england to prepare for the premier league season .
after a lacklustre start to the game that saw neither keeper tested , the eagles opened the scoring on 35 minutes when peter ramage headed home from a jason puncheon corner .

dwight gayle thought he had doubled their lead shortly after when he prodded home from joe ledley 's low cross only for the goal to be ruled out for offside .
tony pulis made no changes to the side after the interval , although marouane chamakh and ramage switched shirt numbers to 6 and 23 respectively .
glen murray doubled the lead with another headed goal coming from a corner ten minutes after the restart .
pulis decided to ring the changes shortly after the second goal , bringing on the likes of barry bannan , stuart o'keefe , adlene guedioura and jerome thomas .
