a woman has opened up about her shock when a picture of her went viral for the wrong reasons - and how she won back her dignity .
ohio native caitlin seida , 24 , wrote on salon.com that she was initially ` kind of amused ' when a friend informed her that her picture had been used on a website that mocked people 's appearances .
