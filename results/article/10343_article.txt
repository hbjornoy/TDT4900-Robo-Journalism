it has been an amazing year of football in many different ways , from the highs and lows of the world cup -- germany 's highs and england 's lows -- to the premier league title race .
for my last column of 2014 , i thought i would dish out some awards for my personal highlights .
i 'm looking forward to another enthralling time in 2015 .
merry christmas !
my three kings of 2014 .
raheem sterling -- no one has grown more as a player in the last 12 months than sterling .
this time last year he had just broken into the liverpool team and now , at 20 , he is one of the best young players in the world .
and if his form is n't quite what it was , that 's only to be expected from a developing talent .
liverpool and england forward raheem sterling has really developed over the last 12 months .
john terry has defied those who said age had caught up with him to produce some stunning form .
john terry -- he 's as solid as he was 10 years ago .
when analysing on tv , nobody says , ` he 's short for pace there ' or ` he turned a bit slowly here ' .
there 's no sign of frailties and there 's not a better defender in the country .
terry with gary cahill would have been fabulous at the world cup , and it would be now .
stewart downing -- he looked as though his career might ebb away , having left liverpool with a big move not having worked out .
but credit to sam allardyce , who has had him playing off the front in many games and seen him rejuvenated .
now the challenge is to sustain that and earn an england place .
goal of the year .
i was in the maracana on that evening when james rodriguez scored for colombia in the last 16 of the world cup against uruguay .
he had his back to play and four players closing him but the key for me was the fact he had a little glance before he shot .
you teach midfielders to look frequently over their shoulder for all-around awareness -- but to do that then play it off his chest
