you should never tempt fate in football but manchester city did just that and were left red-faced ahead of their 1-1 draw with roma in the champions league on tuesday night .
city 's official twitter feed light-heartedly tweeted their italian counterparts ahead of kick-off saying : ` we 're looking forward to hosting you roma , and legendary player such as totti .
he 's never scored in england , has he ?
' the serie a side replied : ` you 're right man city , our capitano has never scored in england .
but there 's always a first time for everything ... ' roma captain francesco totti lifts the ball over goalkeeper joe hart to score his first goal on english soil .
totti celebrates his equalising goal - much to the embarrassment of manchester city 's social media team .
man city foolishly tempted fate by jokingly asking roma whether totti had scored in england before .
roma subsequently had the last laugh when , with 23 minutes on the clock , their captain raced through to coolly chip the ball over the onrushing joe hart .
finding the net for the first time on english soil , totti became the oldest goalscorer in champions league history at the age of 38 years and three days - beating the record previously held by manchester united legend ryan giggs .
after tuesday night 's twitter gaffe , it 's unlikely city will be in a rush to tweet their italian counterparts , bayern munich and cska moscow ahead of the club 's remaining group e fixtures .
