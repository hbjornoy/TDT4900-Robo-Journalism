a corner shop owner embarked on a life of luxury with his wife by executing a ` prince and pauper ' fraud worth # 700,000 .
mohammed arfan , 39 , and his 41-year old wife riffit pocketed almost # 100,000 in tax credits for their four children by saying he was broke and earned only # 5,000 a year .
at the same time the couple claimed they were earning # 100,000 a year using false references to fraudulently claim a string of mortgage loans .
mohammed -lrb- left -rrb- and riffit arfan -lrb- right -rrb- told authorities they earned just # 5,000 but they told banks they earned # 100,000 to fraudulently claim benefits and secure loans to buy businesses , cars and houses .
they owned two homes , two businesses and drove a range rover sport worth # 62,000 and a # 38,000 bmw x5 .
the couple lived in a neat # 200,000 semi-detached house in a cul-de-sac in bury , greater manchester and riffit set up her own fashion business .
their six-year fraud came to an end in 2010 after arfan was arrested and charged with dealing drugs at his off licence in stretford .
police began investigating the couple 's finances and during a two year inquiry discovered they were living a life ` well beyond their means .
' the two houses had been bought as a result of multiple false mortgage applications and riffit was also found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her fashion shop whilst the couple were claiming tax credits and other significant benefits .
she failed to declare the shop to the authorities and even moved a tenant into the flat above - so could illegally pocket housing benefits .
today arfan was starting a three year jail sentence after pleading guilty to 15 offences of mortgage fraud , false accounting , money laundering and fraudulent activity to obtain tax credits .
riffit pleaded guilty to nine offences of mortgage fraud , false accounting , money laundering and acquiring criminal property and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years .
