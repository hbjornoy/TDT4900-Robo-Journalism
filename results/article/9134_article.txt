james middleton 's cake and bread company nice group london limited made a total loss of # 21,148 for the 12 months to march 2013 , the latest accounts filed this week have shown .
it means the company , which was set up in april 2011 , is yet to post a profit , having lost # 19,928 in it 's first year of trading .
the company also owes creditors # 35,951 .
mr middleton meanwhile has had to ask his family for financial help for the business , according to the accounts .
under a section titled ` creditors .
amounts falling due within one year ' , it reads : ` the bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director 's family ' .
mr middleton , 26 , a former public school boy , dropped out of the university of edinburgh in 2006 after a year of studying to go into business .
but he has so far failed to recreate the success of his parents , carol and michael , who made millions with their own party pieces venture .
mr middleton last year told mailonline : ` nice group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company .
' i made the decision to finance the business myself along with a loan rather than go to investors .
` this has its pros and cons , it does mean things do n't move as quickly as i would like but it does mean i keep complete ownership and control over my company .
` further down the line i may look to open the doors for investors but i will see how things go .
