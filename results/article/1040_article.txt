when deb peters took up netball , the idea was to get fit and do something for herself .
she never imagined it would end up saving her life .
after embarking on an impressive fitness regimen of netball , running and swimming and losing four stone , the mother-of-four discovered a small lump .
mrs peters , 46 , from bristol , decided to get it checked by a doctor - and was diagnosed with breast cancer .
she was told that had she not slimmed down , she would never have spotted the 1cm lump .
fighting fit : deb peters lost four stone playing netball .
she then discovered a cancerous lump in her breast that doctors say would have gone undetected had she still been overweight .
mrs peters had not done much sport since school before suddenly taking the decision to get fit about 18 months ago .
she said : ' i do think everything happens for a reason .
what on earth made me think after 30 years i 'm going to get fit ?
' i did n't do anything before .
but three of the children were at school and did n't need picking up and dropping off .
changing habits : mrs peters had not exercised in 30 years until she took up netball , running and swimming .
' i was a bit bored and thought i would just do something .
' she went to netball , started swimming with her son who had recently left the army and took up running .
her consultant explained her out-of-the-blue decision to take up the sport was lucky because it meant her cancer was caught early .
mrs peters said : ` when i saw the lump near my armpit i went to the doctor .
i 'd had lumps before that had been nothing .
` then everything happened so quickly .
you go from not thinking about cancer to meeting the cancer nurse and deciding whether you are going to have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy .
it 's really surreal .
' the lump was removed during surgery at st michael 's hospital , bristol , last december .
mercifully
