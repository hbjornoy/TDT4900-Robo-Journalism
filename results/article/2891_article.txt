with chris froome out , richie porte steps up to become leader of team sky , the first time the british team has ever been led by a non-brit at the tour .
porte is a tough little tasmanian who is famous for marathon training rides , spending his 29th birthday this year , on 30 january , riding 403km - in one day .
` whatever comes into richie 's head he says , ' froome has said .
` richie has no filter .
' video scroll down to watch highlights .
stepping up : australian richie porte will become team sky 's first ever non-british tour de france leader .
bandaged : porte replaces injured 2013 tour de france champion chris froome .
gutted : froome will not get to defend his win in the tour de france last year after his falls and withdrawal .
done : froome calls it a day after another crash made his injuries too severe to continue .
muddy : porte and all the riders endured a difficult fifth stage along france 's cobbles .
video froome ` bitterly disppointed ' with tour withdrawal .
this could be interesting if porte finds himself in the yellow jersey and subject to the kind of grilling the more polite and diplomatic froome was subject to last year .
he has had an up-and-down year but sir dave brailsford , the team sky principal , said on the eve of the tour that porte has hit ` terrific form ' at just the right time .
as well as a great opportunity for porte , froome 's exit could present geraint thomas with a chance to shine .
if porte falters , the welshman could become team leader , not to target the podium , perhaps , but to try and bag stages and see how high he can finish on general classification .
reassess : team sky 's principal sir dave brailsford has been forced to promote porte to team leader .
opportunity : welshman geraint thomas can now target stage wins after froome 's withdrawal .
fresh : thomas has never won a stage at the tour de france but now has the opportunity to do so .
video froome falls as kittel wins again .
