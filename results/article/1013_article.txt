footage : a 14-year-old justin sings ` one less lonely n ***** ' , an adaption of his hit ` one less lonely girl ' where he talks about murdering a black man and joining the racist kkk .
the 24-second clip follows the release of a video a few days ago in which he asked : ` why are black people afraid of chainsaws ?
' before imitating the noise of a chainsaw and saying : ` run n ***** , n ***** , n ***** , n ***** , n ***** ' .
the footage will further jeopardise his career , which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in america and his native canada .
now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage .
he told the sun : ` facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things i 've ever dealt with .
` but i feel now that i need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger .
` at the end of the day , i just need to step up and own what i did .
' he said in a statement : ` i 'm very sorry .
i take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake .
` i was a kid then and i am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again .
