at the end of arsenal 's 1-0 win over southampton on wednesday , the spotlight focused on arsene wenger 's strikeforce .
how can he get danny welbeck to improve after missing a host of chances against saints ?
how much longer can he rely on alexis sanchez to get arsenal out of jail ?
should he get thierry henry at the club as a coach , passing on his expertise , as soon as possible ?
everyone , it seemed , had forgotten about one of the world cup winners missing from arsenal 's ranks .
mesut ozil watched arsenal beat southampton and gave his approval of the result by saying ` job well done ' mesut ozil -lrb- centre -rrb- in action for arsenal against tottenham earlier in the premier league season .
alexis sanchez -lrb- right -rrb- fires past fraser forster -lrb- centre -rrb- of southampton to win all three points for arsenal .
but playmaker mesut ozil watched his team break down ronald koeman 's side and while the performance had plenty of room for improvement , the result got his seal of approval .
` job well done ' he put , alongside a picture of him watching the game wrapped up in a blanket as winter sets in across england .
ozil was ruled out of action for 12 weeks with a knee injury at the start of october and arsenal will no doubt be hoping he can return to top form when he returns in the new year .
