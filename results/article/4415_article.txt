it took four burly men to move a giant 166-kilogram galapagos tortoise onto a truck so it could be moved for its annual weigh in today - possibly the biggest of the species in australia .
the 63-year-old named hugo lives at the australian reptile park on nsw 's central coast and was taken to a nearby vet with industrial scales .
australian reptile park general manager tim faulkner said it was not an easy task moving such a massive animal , which could be the largest in australia .
' i think it 's likely he one of the biggest and quite possibly he would be up there with the heaviest , if not the heaviest , ' he told daily mail australia .
four australian reptile park keepers moved a gigantic 166-kilogram galapagos tortoise onto a truck so it could be weighed at a nearby vet today .
named hugo , the 63-year-old tortoise was found to be in good health and put on one-kilogram since last year .
` four big men moving 166 kilograms - each man taking a 40 kilogram portion or more is quite a bit to carry , ' he said .
once at the vet , a forklift was used to get the gigantic animal off the truck and carrots were used to coax the huge animal on to the scales by the four reptile keepers .
tipping the scales at 166 kilograms , the tortoise 's weight increased by one-kilogram on last year 's weigh in and mr faulkner said this was a sign of good health .
` he 's considered a teenager turning into a man .
he 's in the prime of this life , they can live up to 150 to 200 years , ' he said .
australian reptile park general manager tim faulkner said the believed the tortoise could be the heaviest in australia .
a galapagos tortoise can live up to 200 years mr faulkner said .
` the fact that he 's put on a kilo , it 's nice but we 're not trying to get him to put it on - the weigh in is a condition of health .
it 's about maintenance to make sure he 's retaining and keeping the weight .
' mr faulkner said it was a slow process for the animals to put on weight
