andy lee will be onto a winner no matter what happens on saturday night .
the 30-year-old arrived in new york on a crest of a wave , a newly crowned world champion eager to lap up the first defence of the title he won so superbly before christmas .
and his future took the most unexpected of twists on friday night after american peter quillin , the undefeated former wbo middleweight champion , failed to make required 160 lbs weight ensuring the battle at the barclays center will have no title on the line .

lee 's bout on saturday will no longer be a title fight after quillin failed to make the 160lb weight .
lee was hoping to make his first defence of the wbo middleweight title he won against matt korobov last year .
lee works out with trainer adam booth at the barclays centre ahead of his showdown with quillin .
quillin says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line .
quillin , who had been out for a year , initially hit the scales at 161.9 and despite a quick run and hope session on the treadmill saw him register 160.6 , it was not enough .
naturally , the irishman still wants to impress , especially with the event screened live on us tv to an expected audience of millions .
yet when the bells goes , he knows nothing can destroy his own title dream .
` he came back onto the scales and in the end it was just too much for him to lose , ' said trainer adam booth .
` you can lose three pounds in a short space of time but it did n't happen .
andy still has to go out and do a job .
' i think he knew he was n't going to make the weight but he still tried .
he lost 0.8 of a pound knowing that he was n't going to make it .
he tried his arse off .
` he could n't make it .
that 's not our problem .
all andy can do is his job .
