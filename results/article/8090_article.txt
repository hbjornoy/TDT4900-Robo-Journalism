kate gilbert before -lrb- l -rrb- and after -lrb- r -rrb- , has slimmed eight stone so she can slip into the outfit for her dream role .
kate , who has been part of the group for 12 years , struggled with her weight for a long time , especially since her hip replacement five years ago .
the events manager said : ' i knew that it might be a struggle to convince directors that i was fitting to be cast as fairy when i was stomping around on the stage .
` now i 've never felt or looked better and i 'm a much better fit for the tinkerbell costume !
' for years , kate had been consigned to roles for women many years her senior .
her extra pounds meant she could n't pass for characters her own age and she ended up masquerading as the white witch in the lion , the witch and the wardrobe and the red queen in alice and wonderland .
desperate to prove that she had the looks as well as the voice to match the character , kate began an impressive diet focussed on curbing carbs .
shge said at 22 st it might be a struggle to convince directors that she was fitting to be cast as fairy .
she used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops .
she went from indulging in multipacks of sweets and crisps every single day to not touching carbohydrates at all and ditching sugary snacks .
kate also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out , riding , and tending for horses at her local stables .
her husband is also delighted with her achievement .
