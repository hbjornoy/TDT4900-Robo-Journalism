michael carrick says he still hopes to be involved in manchester united 's clash with chelsea on sunday after playing just over an hour for the red devils ' under 21s against west ham .
carrick barely broke into a sweat as he sat in front of a back four , reading the game with trademark intelligence as he coasted through their 2-1 win .
he returned to the bench for united 's 2-2 draw at west brom on monday but manager louis van gaal seemed to have ruled him out of sunday 's game , claiming the midfielder needs more minutes under his belt as he returns from an ankle injury .
manchester united star michael carrick got 64 minutes under his belt against his former side .
carrick warmed up with his manchester united team-mates before taking part in the under 21 match .
carrick was joined by fellow senior star anders lindegaard in united 's starting line-up to play west ham .
red devils star carrick was an unused substitute against west brom on monday night .
west ham u21s : howes , westley , page , makasi , onariase , pask , bywater , nasha , lee , lletget , gordan .
subs : knoyle , boness , fanimo , mavila .
manchester united u21s : lindegaard , vermijl , thorpe , blackett , james , janko , carrick , a.pereira , weir , wilson , w.keane .

but carrick insists his appearance at west ham 's academy ground on friday night does not mean he is ruled out of contention on sunday and the england midfielder says he still hopes to play a part against the league leaders at old trafford .
carrick , speaking exclusively to sportsmail , said : ` i 'm realistic , i 've got to be patient .
i 've been out for five and a half months so i 've got to understand the bigger picture .
i 'm not saying i wo n't be involved on sunday , hopefully i can be in some way .
' i do n't know yet though , i 'll just have to wait and see .
i 'm just being patient really , i 've got to understand the situation .
` it 's been a long time .
