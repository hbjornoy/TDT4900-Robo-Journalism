a farmer is turning one of his fields into a stone age-style burial chamber where families can pay # 1,000 to bury their relatives ' ashes .
wiltshire landowner tim daw , 52 , is laying down huge sarsen stones , similar to those at nearby stonehenge , to form the base of a burial mound which will eventually hold the remains of 2,400 people .
the diggers moved in to his field at all cannings , near marlborough , after he won planning permission to build a 50m-long mound , the first such chamber to be built in britain for 5,000 years .
wiltshire farmer tim daw , 52 , is turning one of his fields into a ` neolithic-style ' burial mound .
mr daw says that that 50-metre long mound at all cannings should be completed within six months .
how it will look : the design of the all cannings burial mound is based on west kennet long barrow nearby .
mr daw says it will take him six months to complete the mound , which will contain seven large chambers , each with several shelves containing lockable alcoves , or niches , that can be secured for a family .
he plans to charge around # 1,000 for a family niche with space for the ashes of up to eight people .
the farmer , an atheist who works as a steward at stonehenge , said : ` we 've already had five people sign up , and that 's without really pushing it at all .
` it 's being made of sarsen stones weighing up to one tonne each and is quite a simple construction .
we will have to keep the inside secure as other people 's remains will be in there too , but the idea is that it will be a place for families to come .
` they 'll be able to sit and contemplate on the mound ' .
mr daw said the burial chamber will be non-religious , but it is already attracting interest from pagans because of its alignment , designed to allow the sunrise of the winter solstice to shine through the entrance and down its passageway .
