sampdoria are hoping to complete the signing of everton forward samuel eto'o on tuesday .
the genoa outfit has been in talks with everton and eto'o 's representatives in recent weeks with a view to completing the move for the 33-year-old .
` eto'o should be here in genoa on tuesday , ' samp sporting director carlo osti told italian tv station telenord .
everton striker samuel eto'o is on the verge of signing for serie a side sampdoria .
eto'o rises highest to score the opening goal in everton 's game against burnley in october .
eto'o , who joined everton only five months ago from chelsea , is set to sign an 18-month contract with the genoa outfit .
the 33-year-old has reportedly reduced his wages by 40 per cent in order to return to serie a .
the former cameroon striker spent two seasons at inter milan and was a member of the nerazurri 's 2010 treble-winning side that won the serie a title , coppa italia and champions league under then head coach jose mourinho .
osti , whose side sold top scorer manolo gabbiadini to napoli earlier this month , also confirmed that colombia striker luis muriel and italian defender andrea coda will be joining samp later this week from udinese .
eto'o shakes hands with everton manager roberto martinez after signing from chelsea .
eto'o is fouled by manchester city midfielder yaya toure .
both players had agreed terms with samp last week but the deal fell through after udinese pulled the plug following a difference of opinion on muriel 's injury .
` the signings of muriel and coda will become official shortly , ' osti said .
sampdoria , who are coached by sinisa mihajlovic , are flying high in serie a this season and are currently fourth in the standings , level on 33 points with third-placed napoli .
eto'o nets a second goal against burnley in october .
