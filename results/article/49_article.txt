aston villa are close to signing swansea city midfielder ki sung-yueng for a fee approaching # 6million .
paul lambert is determined to strengthen his squad and the purchase of the south korea international would be the club 's first significant outlay of the summer .
borrowed : ki was on loan at sunderland for most of the 2013-14 season from swansea .
ki , 25 , returned from the world cup in brazil as one of his country 's better performers but has one year left on his contract in south wales .
it is believed ki , who was on loan at sunderland last season after signing from celtic in 2012 , has held productive talks with lambert and a deal could be completed this week .
he has not travelled with the swansea squad for their pre-season tour to america because of his world cup commitments .
challenge : lambert is determined to strengthen his squad ahead of what will surely be a tough season .
he would bring technique and experience to the villa midfield and the move indicates owner randy lerner is prepared to release substantial cash despite the club being up for sale .
it marks a departure from previous summer business as joe cole , 32 , and philippe senderos , 29 , have joined for free , while the price paid for fulham 's kieran richardson , 29 , was around # 600,000 .
lambert also wants to offer new contracts to holland defender ron vlaar , who shone at the world cup , fabian delph and gabriel agbonlahor .
all three have just a year left on their current deals .
keep him : villa want to tie up the contract of ron vlaar , who performed admirably for holland at the world cup .
