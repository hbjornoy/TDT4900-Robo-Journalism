when michael mctigue returns home after a hard day 's work , he opens his front door and steps back more than 70 years .
for the 45-year-old bus driver is a one-man time-warp from the 1930s .
his clothes and semi-detached home are all in keeping with his obsession with britain on the eve of world war ii .
a vintage telephone stands on the hall .
table beside an exquisite art deco lamp , just a foretaste to the living .
room that 's packed with mirrors , clocks , ornaments and picture frames .
from the era .
houseproud : michael relaxes by the wireless in his front room as neighbour pam tries out the 1938 hoover .
all mod cons : left ; a dial telephone would have been the latest thing .
and the lamp the height of fashion and there 's a copy of his favourite .
paper on the chair and right ; a jumble of 1930s wooden-shafted golf .
clubs , straw boaters , a metal raf case , leather suitcases .

a banjo .
mr mctigue is never seen wearing anything out of keeping with his favourite era -- except in the cab of his bus .
he does n't own a washing machine and instead laborious scrubs his clothes outside in a dolly tub then squeezes them through a mangle .
his hoover dates from 1938 .
` i 'm really a time traveller who lost his way , ' he says .
` but i 'm 45 , so it 's too late to change now !
i just love the era , it was a much simpler time .
' mr mctigue 's home , in riddleton , west yorks , was unmodernised when he bought it seven years ago -- the couple who had owned it since it was built in 1936 had lived there for more than 50 years .
since then he has set about collecting suitable antiques , old newspapers and knick-knacks from car-boot sales .
he .
says : ` my clothes are from the era , too .
but as i 'm 6ft 4in i 've had to .
get most of them tailor-made using authentic materials , as there .
