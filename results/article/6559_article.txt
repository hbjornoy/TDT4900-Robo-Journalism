do you have trouble dropping off at night ?
the solution may have arrived .
designer joe manus has created a revolutionary piece of furniture : a rocking bed , encased in a circular frame , to lull you gently to sleep .
joe wanted the bed 's motion to mimic a baby being rocked to sleep .
he says he wanted to create a space where you could : ` dream your dreams , love your lover , and rest your soul .
' rock-a-bye baby : joe manus built the rocking bed , designed to help people drift off to sleep .
built for indoor slumber or stargazing outside , the rocking bed comes with a rubber stop that allows you to lock the bed in place or let it move freely .
we 'd advise using it on hilly terrain .
the design can even be tweaked to fit your taste : the carbon steel frame can be blackened , brushed or even be replaced with wood and is available in twin , full , king and queen sizes .
but a peaceful night 's sleep does n't come cheap : this quirky piece of furniture , available on shinerinternational.com , will set you back # 1980.95 .
sleep like a baby : the movement of the # 1,980 bed mimics the action of an infant being rocked to sleep .
those who sleep for six to seven hours per night have a longer life expectancy than those who slumber for eight hours.randy gardner , 17 , set the world record going the longest time without sleep in 1964 , when he stayed awake for 264 hours and 12 minutes.the average person wakes up about six times each night .12 per cent of people have black and white dreams .
before color television though , the number was 75 per cent.if it takes you less than five minutes to fall asleep then you are probably sleep deprived .
the ideal amount of time is about 10 minutes .
