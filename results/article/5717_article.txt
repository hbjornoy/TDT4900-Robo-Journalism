over an 18 month crime spree denis 's haul includes a bath towel , a thong , a football , five paintbrushes , a pair of slippers , an designer shirt , a doll and gloves .

cheeky cat denis , now known as denis the menace to his neighbours , with his haul of stolen goods .
he has taken men 's boxer shorts , a pair of shoes , a cardigan , a dog chew , dozens of pairs of socks , a chamois leather , tea towels , seven car sponges and a cuddly toy .
victims of the two-year-old black and white cat 's antics often turn up at mrs newman 's home in luton , bedfordshire , when their belongings go missing .
the first theft was recorded just a week after he was let out of the house for the first time , with his stolen stash growing week on week until he began carrying home t-shirts in his mouth , often having to jump over garden fences along the way .
his largest prize to date is a bath towel which he dragged through the streets and his most expensive is a fred perry polo short .
on one occasion he retrieved a woman 's sandal from a garden in a neighbouring road - and returned a week later to pinch the other one .
many of the items have fallen off washing lines as they often have clothes pegs still attached .
