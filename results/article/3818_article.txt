when she was the most famous hooker in showbusiness - thanks to career-defining roles in the 1986 film mona lisa and kay mellor 's 90s tv hit band of gold - cathy tyson had a reputation for being a bit chippy .
she 'd arrive late for interviews , answer questions dismissively and even turned hollywood down after being told to lose weight .

bob made me instantly feel at ease .
he invited me around to dinner before we started shooting the movie and from the beginning he was a lovely , encouraging man .
he always had a big wide smile on his face and you could talk to him about anything .
