they 're the toughest arctic waters in the world - almost mythical in their ability to frustrate sailors , with extreme icy conditions rendering them largely off limits .
but now a cruise line is offering intrepid travellers the chance to face the northwest passage - the route through northern coast of north america , connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans .
