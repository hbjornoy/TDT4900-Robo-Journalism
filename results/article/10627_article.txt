on the subject of scoring he said : ' i got annoyed with myself for the first miss -lsb- against valencia -rsb- there was a doubt in the finish , i changed my mind just as i was going to hit it .
it was a good job we won because i would have felt even worse .
then i scored a perfectly good goal that was wrongly ruled out for offside .
' i have to get back to just going with my instinct .
i had a chance in cyprus in the champions league -lsb- against apoel -rsb- when leo set me up and i had the far post to aim for but i wanted to make absolutely sure and tried to hit it hard .
i have to forget myself a bit and just go with instinct .
' barcelona are currently two points behind real madrid in the table having lost the clasico last month .
` we know it is going to be difficult because real madrid are very strong but they can slip at any time as we have slipped in the past , that happens in football .
we have to keep getting better game by game and we know the obligation is to win , ' he said .
