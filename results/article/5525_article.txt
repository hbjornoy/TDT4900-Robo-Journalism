the actor has appeared in two of ken loach 's earlier movies - sweet sixteen in 2002 and tickets in 2005 .
gary , who has been working as a binman for the last 10 years , said he had no intention of giving up his job despite flying off to promote the film with mr loach next month .
he works from 7.30 am to 3.30 pm cleaning the streets of south lanarkshire .
speaking from the south lanarkshire council bin depot in rutherglen , scotland , gary said : ` we are all mates here , i come in at 7.30 am and i have my bit to do like anyone else - being in a movie does n't change that .
` but i am on the look-out for an agent .
i have a couple of calls in and i 'm waiting for a response and obviously if the right part came up i would do it , it 's a no-brainer .
