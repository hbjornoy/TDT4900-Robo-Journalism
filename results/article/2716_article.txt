a mother has revealed her joy at learning that her son , who was abducted by his paternal grandparents in 1994 when he was just five years old , is alive , married and expecting his first child .
for nearly 20 years , lisa harter knew nothing of the whereabouts of her son , richard landers jr. , after his grandparents vanished from their trailer in wolcottville , indiana with the young boy .
they had been raising the child at their home and are believed to have taken off with him as they were unhappy with the court granting mrs harter custody for a trial period .
but now detectives have tracked him down through his social security number and discovered the 24-year-old living 680 miles away in long prairie , minnesota under the name michael jeff landers .
