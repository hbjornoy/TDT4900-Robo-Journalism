martin and kushner did n't hesitate to jump into the mud and pull the weak canine to safety .
pluto was away from home and without food or water for three days as he struggled to free himself from the mud .
the dog was close to death and too exhausted to even muster a wag of his tail as the officers loaded him onto a makeshift gurney .
weakened : the police officers load pluto onto a plank to carry him to safety .
recovery : pluto rests , still muddied from his three-day ordeal , at the veterinary clinic .
subdued : pluto at home recovering after being released from the vet .
home safe : pluto and a little friend at safe and sound at home .
pluto 's owner took him to sugartown veterinary hospital where he was treated .
the pooch is now back home with his family and doing well .
pluto 's owner said , ` we feel very fortunate indeed that you are there and always quick to respond , skilled and compassionate .
' had he remained much longer in the dangerous mud , pluto would surely have died .
photographs and video from the rescue show that pluto 's nose was barely clearing the surface of the mud when the officers rescued him .
the mud was likely caused by torrential rains and severe flooding that affected pennsylvania about two weeks ago .
