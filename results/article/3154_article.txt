killer : william cornick -lrb- left -rrb- was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 20 years at leeds crown court after he admitted murdering teacher ann maguire -lrb- right -rrb- .
his appeal was rejected in london today .
but today , the panel of three judges at the court of appeal in london , headed by the lord chief justice lord thomas , rejected cornick 's appeal against the minimum term .
they said that based on the ` disturbing ' facts of the case , the sentencing judge came to ` entirely the right decision ' .
at his hearing last year , leeds crown court heard cornick sent a facebook message weeks before the killing , which said of mrs maguire : ` the one absolute f ****** b *** h that deserves more than death , more than pain and more than anything that we can understand .
' he later told a psychiatrist : ' i was n't in shock , i was happy .
i had a sense of pride .
i still do .
' the boy also said after the killing that he thought everything he had done was ` fine and dandy ' .
mrs maguire had taught there for more than 40 years and was due to retire that september .
handing him a life sentence in november , mr justice coulson said he showed a ` chilling lack of remorse ' over the attack that saw him chase mrs maguire , ` stabbing her as she sought to escape ' .
