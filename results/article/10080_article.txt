sex pistols front-man johnny rotten - real name john lydon - urged voters to ignore russell brand .
veteran punk front-man johnny rotten has urged youngsters to ignore russell brand -- and make sure they get out and use their vote .
the sex pistols lead singer , who once claimed to be the antichrist who wanted to ` destroy passers-by ' , said brand was a ` b ** hole ' .
rotten , also known by his real name john lydon , said : ` if you do n't vote , you do n't count .
it 's only a century ago that none of us had the right to vote and we do n't want to go back to that route .
' the 58-year-old refused to say who he supported , adding : ` i 'm very wary of tagging my name on to supporting any of those phoney b ***** ds , but do n't be like russell brand .
' the remarks , to the cheltenham literature festival , come after mr brand sparked controversy after calling on voters to ignore the upcoming election .
the hollywood star and comedian told the bbc : ` do n't bother voting .
stop voting stop pretending , wake up , be in reality now .
why vote ?
we know it 's not going to make any difference .
' he added : ` it is not that i am not voting out of apathy .
i am not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies , treachery and deceit of the political class that has been going on for generations .
' brand said mr lydon 's experience at state school ` seemed to primarily be the installation of a belief system that placed his generation and class at the bottom of an immovable hierarchical structure ' .
but mr lydon urged people dissatisfied with politics to take their grievances to their local council .
` go to town hall meetings and give them f *** ing hell , ' he said .
` i 'm not being flippant .
if you do n't start locally you 're not going to change the world .
' it is not the first time mr brand 's comments have been criticised in public .
former home secretary david blunkett said the comments
