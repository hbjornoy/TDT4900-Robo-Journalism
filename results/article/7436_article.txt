the bombshell secret videos of mitt romney at a florida fundraiser in may miss out ` one to two minutes ' of the republican nominee 's remarks , the magazine that released the footage has admitted .
it may never be known what was said in the gap between the two parts of the 49-minute video .
the missing section is shortly after romney 's now infamous comment that ` there are 47 percent who are with him -lsb- president obama -rsb- , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims .

we poll all these people to see where you stand in the polls but 45 percent of the people vote for the republicans and 48 or 49 ... ' mystery minutes : the embarrassing secret videos of mitt romney at a florida fundraiser in may may be short ` one to two minutes ' of the republican 's full remarks .
in the second , it picks up with romney talking about a completely different subject : ' ... about twice as much as china , not 10 times as much like is reported .

' david corn , the mother jones reporter who broke the story , told politico that the video was published as he received it from his unidentified source .
` when we put up the full video , the source said - and i have no reason not to believe him - that the device that was being used inadvertently shut down or timed-out , ' he told politico .
` as soon as he knew that , he turned .
the camera back on and , at most , one to two minutes were missed .
the .
video came to me as two separate files , and that is how we posted it on .
the website .
