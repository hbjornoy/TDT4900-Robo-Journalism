eden hazard has been the best player in the premier league all season and on saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to chelsea 's imminent title victory .
he is now the player you look to in a crisis .
he is the man who has been eking out wins when the team has n't been at its best .
he did it last week at queens park rangers , winning the ball from the goalkeeper 's kick and driving into the box to set up cesc fabregas , and he did it on saturday with his finish .
he 's dragging them over the line at the minute .
you wondered when jose mourinho came in whether hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him .
and he would have taken the hint when he saw juan mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players .
eden hazard fires past david de gea following a storming run from the belgian star into the box .
hazard celebrates in front of the stamford bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike .
the chelsea forward 's first-half strike proved crucial as the blues eked out a 1-0 victory .
he perhaps looked at that and responded .
you will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back -- but not today , not against the best teams .
then he is required to do the requisite defensive work .
and he does now .
but the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing -- and that was evident again on saturday .
he 's now on 17 goals for the season .
he 's always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals .
he is the danger man , he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team .
he 's not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he 's creeping ever closer .
what he will need to reach that level is for chelsea to make a champions league final and for him to be decisive .
