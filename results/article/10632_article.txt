an elderly british couple have been knocked down and killed in america whilst trying to cross a five lane freeway in america to reach a roadside diner .
edward mcelroy , 76 , and his 70-year old wife brenda were thought to have been walking hand-in-hand when they were hit by a pick-up truck - just 24 hours after they arrived in the us for a last-minute ` fly drive ' holiday .
a nurse attempted to give first aid to the couple , but both were pronounced dead at the scene having been killed instantly .
tragedy : brenda and edward mcelroy from blackpool , lancashire , who have been killed in a horror crash while on holiday in america .
retired loss adjuster mr mcelroy , known as ted , and his wife , a former customer services advisor , had travelled to west virginia where ` leaf peepers ' were visiting to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in autumn .
the couple , from blackpool , lancashire , who have three children and three grandchildren , booked into a best western hotel in barboursville and tragedy struck as they were crossing the road to get to a restaurant which had been recommended to them .
their eldest daughter gillian , 49 , has now flown to the us to arrange for the bodies to be repatriated back to england .
on monday mrs mcelroy 's sister eileen dobson , 65 , said : ` we 're all devastated and so sad especially after we saw them only last week for ted 's birthday .
` they were so excited and were telling us about the trip .
i asked if they were looking forward to it and they said they could n't wait .
it 's heart-breaking - they were so full of life .
' she added : ` ted and brenda had initially booked a holiday to go and stay with a friend in kentucky but they could n't go because the friend had a stroke and was n't well enough to put them up .
` when they came to try and change the flight it was going to cost them a lot
