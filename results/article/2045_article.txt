property developers using heavy machinery tore down a irreplaceable 4,000-year-old pyramid near peru 's capital of lima .
rafael varon , deputy minister of cultural patrimony , told reporters the destruction occurred over the weekend at the 20 foot tall ruins of el paraiso , a few miles north of lima .
his agency has lodged criminal complaints against companies alisol and provelanz for the weekend 's damage and has moved to seize the equipment used .
property developers have reportedly destroyed part of the ruins at el paraiso peru .
no-one was available for comment at either company .
peru 's tourism ministry says el paraiso was built some 4,000 years ago and was a religious and administrative center , long before the rise of the inca culture encountered by the spanish conquerors .
marco guilen , director of an excavation project at el paraiso , said the people who tore down the pyramid ` have committed irreparable damage to a page of peruvian history .
' experts have said that the destruction has caused ` irreparable damage to a page of peruvian history ' ` we are not going to be able to know in what ways it was constructed , what materials were used in it and how the society in that part of the pyramid behaved .
' varon said people apparently working for the two companies tore down one pyramid and tried to destroy three others , but were stopped by witnesses .
mayor freddy ternero from the town where the ruins are located , san martin de porres , said the pyramids were located in agricultural fields and were not guarded , though he said the minister of the interior sent police to protect it after the incident .
