a widowed mother of two has won a # 30,000 payout after her boss groped her and made lewd comments about her in front of clients .
jennifer newman , 34 , was called ` proper top totty ' by steve hoad and described as dressing like ` someone who works in a dubious establishment ' .
hoad 's wife , who also worked at the firm , accused her of having an affair with her husband before she was sacked as recruitment manager .
mrs newman said she joined the company , hydro cleansing , in april last year and problems began in june when hoad emailed her a picture of a semi-naked woman in bondage gear , asking : ` have you got a suit like this ?
' then , to the laughter of colleagues , he added : ` she does look like you .
' on another occasion he threw a pen to the floor in front of clients and asked her to pick it up , but when she walked off he said : ` look at that , proper top totty ' to laughter from the clients .
she said his inappropriate comments increased when she had breast enhancement surgery .
the final straw came on july 10 last year when hoad groped her bottom after she asked for an advance on her salary to take her two daughters on holiday .
mrs newman , whose husband died in a car crash in 2009 , told the employment tribunal in croydon , south london : ` i felt absolutely violated , upset and demeaned .
` it was as though steve felt that by asking for an advance on my salary it gave him the right to touch me .
' the # 32,000-a-year executive , who lives in croydon , reported the incident to hr as a protected disclosure , which employers are bound under british law to treat confidentially .
however , the details were leaked to staff including hoad 's wife , carol .
the tribunal was given an account of a car journey taken by mrs newman and
