for tina yates , a pensioner from hertfordshire , a single visit to a nudist party with her husband mark was all it took to convince her to embrace the lifestyle for herself .
' i had a bad body image .
i 'd had an operation and i 've got what i think is a huge scar and a disfiguring scar , and mark took me along to a nature swim , ' she remembers .
` and , you know , i do n't notice it anymore .
it gives you lots of confidence .
you know i am who i am , and you can see my life on my face but you can also see the life on my body .
' naked ambition : tina , third from left , says that becoming a nudist has made her feel happier with her physique .
tina is one of a growing number of british people to embrace a nudist - or naturist - lifestyle and now lives in the uk 's second biggest naked community , spielplatz .
located close to st albans in the village of bricket wood , the 12 acre ` community ' was founded in 1929 by charles macaskie and his wife dorothy in a stretch of woodland as a retreat for themselves and their friends .
among them was ross nichols , a cambridge academic and founder of the order of bards , ovates and druids , a neo-pagan group , and his friend , gerald gardner , the father of modern wicca who established his first coven at the bricket wood site .
while wicca plays little part in modern life at spielplatz , nudity and a communal lifestyle most certainly does .
friendly : tina and her husband live at spielplatz , a naturist community located just outside st albans .
` it 's basically a normal life , ' explains tina .
` my neighbours are lots of different ages and some were even born here .
` it 's just a small .
community and very much a community where everybody gets to know everyone else .
' so established is the community , even delivery drivers dropping off ocado or asos deliveries have become a regular part of life at spielplatz .
` everybody delivers to us , ' adds tina .
