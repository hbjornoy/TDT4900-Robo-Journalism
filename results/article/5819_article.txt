leaning over police crime scene tape , i 'm peering into what was once a kennel .
there is no roof , and the floor is covered with blackened material .
the acrid smell is horrendous .
among the rubble are dog collars , a tennis ball and several chew toys .
when the manchester dogs ' home was set on fire on september 11 , killing 60 dogs in the adoption unit , my feeling was that there really is no hope for mankind .
on my visit to what is left of the home i meet sandy , a staffie who was one of only two dogs pulled alive from the burned-down wing .
she had come to the home five months before as a stray .
scroll down for video .
rescued : liz with staffie sandy , one of only two dogs from a unit within the manchester dogs home to have survived the blaze .
though only about five or six years old , she has obviously already had several litters , perhaps bred for dog-fighting .
she was in the adoption unit as she was deemed ready to be rehomed .
once pulled from the fire , sandy was rushed to the home 's sister site in cheshire and placed in intensive care .
she remains on medication for the effects of smoke inhalation and has nightmares .
anna stansfield , manager of the site , says : ` i hear her crying and groaning in her sleep , and she paddles with her paws .
she has been very depressed .
' the other survivor , two-year-old badger , has already been rehomed .
a lovely dark lurcher with white paws , he was adopted by a local family , the corfields , who got a bit carried away and took two other dogs home too .
badger 's only legacy from the fire is a cough and an abscess , and a propensity to sleep a lot .
fourteen-year-old maddie corfield took badger to school to help raise awareness for the home , and to show classmates how a rescue dog can be more rewarding than purchasing a pedigree .
donations from the public have now reached # 1.4 million , which means the damaged wing can be demolished this week , and a bigger , better kennel built to rescue many
