a glass of wine or a relaxing bath can be the perfect remedy after a stressful day .
and now you can combine the two without fear of spilling a drop thanks to a new invention .
a pair of brothers from the u.s. have created the ` sipcaddy ' - a portable cup holder that can hold wine glasses that can be attached to the side of a bath or shower .
it has a suction pad that sticks to smooth surfaces and it can hold beer cans , bottles , cups , and many other household items .
unwind : a new invention allows people to relax in the bath while enjoying a glass of wine .
sipcaddy was designed and developed by a small team of drinking enthusiasts , architects , and designers , led by two brothers , carson and keefe .
the creators say that the $ 13.95 -lrb- # 8.91 -rrb- cup holder is ideal for enjoying a glass of wine or cold beer in the bath .
the device is made of strong , durable , recyclable abs plastic and is dishwasher safe .
versatile : the product can hold both wine glasses and cans and was developed by brothers in the u.s .
the team say their product is different from other cup holders on the market because of its versatility .
it can hold bottles , wine glasses , champagne flutes , slim coffee mugs , solo cups , regular cups , and a wide variety of bathroom products weighing up to 24oz .
carson , from atlanta , who has a degree in economics from georgia state university told mailonline : ' i always joked around about drinking beer in the shower .
when i researched it , there was n't even a quality portable cup holder out there .
' i saw that a few companies had a wine holder , but that idea has been done many times in the last 10 years and they are all far from innovative : all of them being just a flat piece of plastic with a slit in it .
' i like baths too and it suddenly occurred to me that i could have a cup holder with a gap in the front that could hold stemware .
this does n't affect the functionality of the cup holder at all
