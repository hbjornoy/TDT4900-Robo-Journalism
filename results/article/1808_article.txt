paedophile : michael brignull has been jailed for 11 years but the mother of one of his victims refused to believe that her child was abused .
a mother has spoken of her shame after she refused to believe her daughter was abused until police showed her a photograph of her being attacked by a paedophile now in jail for his sex crimes .
michael brignull , 60 , was a described as a ` surrogate grandfather ' to the young woman but it later emerged he abused her throughout her childhood .
he is is starting an 11-year prison sentence after he was convicted of possessing child pornography and a string of attacks including two attempted rapes .
the girl 's mother , 43 , who can not be named for legal reasons , said his crimes ` ripped her family apart ' because they had known brignull for 27 years .
` we were so close mick used to come to our house for christmas dinner and my children used to stay with him for school holidays , ' she said .
` he was a surrogate grandfather to them .
' the victim , now aged 17 , was at her brother 's 18th birthday party , when she told a family friend she was being abused by brignull , of thorney bay caravan park , canvey , essex .
her mother said : ` my first reaction was `` oh my god , she is a bloody liar '' .
i thought she was jealous her brother was getting all the attention because it was his 18th .
i 110 per cent did not believe her .
' the next day the mother confronted her then 16-year-old daughter .
she said : ' i said to her `` put your coat on , we are going to the police station '' .
she was hysterical and refused to go .
then a few days later she wrote me a letter explaining what mick had done to her .
` she said she did n't want to talk about it , so i wrote her a letter back .
we carried on like that .
writing letters back and forwards to eachother .
` then i took the letters to the police .
