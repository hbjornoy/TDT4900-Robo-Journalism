justin rose will try to take a leaf out of rory mcilroy 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters .
rose arrived at augusta national having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the pga tour , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in masters history .
` i 'm really excited about the rest of the year now .
it 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said rose , who was looking to become the first european player to win the us open and masters .
justin rose was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament .
rose believes that his finish of second at augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead .
rose wants to follow the lead of rory mcilroy , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 .
' i tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well .
` you look at rory 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer -lrb- winning the open , bridgestone invitational and us pga in the space of four weeks -rrb- .
i was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year .
very happy it turned around this week in a major championship .
` the thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw .
' i was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday .
i think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon .

` there 's two ways to look at it .
