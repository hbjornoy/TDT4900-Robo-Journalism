angelo mathews insists england are still the team under pressure in the sixth one-day international in pallekele despite their impressive win at the same venue to trail only 3-2 in the series .
alastair cook 's tourists narrowed the gap and kept themselves in with a chance after all of starting their world cup winter with a series success , if they can win the final two matches against sri lanka .
mathews , however , remains confident his team are capable of much better - as long as his spinners make the most of home conditions .
england narrowed their deficit in the series to 3-2 after five odis thanks to an impressive joe root century .
` the pressure is still on england , ' he said , after fine performances from chris woakes with the ball and then centurion joe root and james taylor with the bat had redressed the balance in a match spread over two days because of rain .

` there might be a few changes , ' said mathews .
