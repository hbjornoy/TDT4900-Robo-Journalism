the eye surgeon who trained bashar assad in london has delivered a damning indictment of his former student , saying he is ` not a strong leader ' and should have remained a doctor .
south african-born edmund schulenburg , who trained dr bashar , as he was known at the western eye clinic at london 's st mary 's hospital , said : ` when he left in 1994 after two years , i remember thinking that he was really better suited to being an eye surgeon than a leading politician .
` i thought he was not strong enough .
i do n't think he is a strong leader .

his tutor said as a young man he was sensitive , polite and humble .
contrary to the syrian president 's image as a thug and a murderer , mr schulenburg remembered ` a sensitive young man who was incredibly polite and punctual ' .
` everyone who worked with him found him that way , ' said mr schulenburg .
` he was n't arrogant .
you would never have guessed he was a president 's son .
` he was quiet and never really spoke about his family .

' assad spent 18 months in london , living on his own in a rented flat , avoiding any obvious signs that he was the son of a powerful middle eastern dictator .
he was fond of phil collins and whitney houston music , and thrilled by technology and computers .
but in 1994 , after the death of his older brother basel in a car crash , bashar was recalled to syria and groomed for the role of president .
in june 2000 , after the death of his father , he took over the role of leader
