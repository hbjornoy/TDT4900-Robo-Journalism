after booking a table at their local pub for a traditional turkey lunch , the chaplins thought they had taken all the stress out of christmas .
until , that is , one family member 's car broke down on the way to the meal .
determined that husband mark should n't miss out on the # 35 a head feast they had already paid for , nina chaplin asked pub staff to wrap up his meal so he could enjoy it later .
disgusted : nina chaplin and her daughter abigail chaplin with the # 35-a-head dinner from the cricketers pub in rainham , kent .
takeaway : the family asked for a dinner to be packaged and brought home after mark chaplin missed the meal due to a broken down car .

inside one box , she described finding a sealed plastic bag with three pieces of soggy turkey that appeared to have been pre-packed .
` it looked like something i could pick up from iceland for # 1.99 , ' said the mother of four .
` my husband was so upset he binned his meal and made himself a bacon sandwich instead -- that was his christmas dinner .

she booked a table at the cricketers -- part of the greene king chain and her late mother 's favourite pub -- for a three-course lunch costing # 35 each for adults and # 17 each for children .
but the dishes that were presented to the chaplins were less than appetising .
feeling empty : mrs chaplin described the dinner as ` something i could pick up
