happily married : rod stewart reveals how he keeps wife penny lancaster happy .
as most parents know only too well , having children in the house can be something of a passion-killer .
but as a former rock-and-roll lothario , rod stewart is determined not to let family life get in the way of romance .
the 68-year-old has revealed he sleeps with wife penny lancaster ` three quality times ' a week and regularly whisks her away on holiday so they can spend more time alone .
he said he hires a nanny to take care of the children and takes lingerie model miss lancaster , 42 , to their # 3million beach house in florida where he seduces her with ` champagne and candlelight ' .
` you 've got to understand when you 've got two small kids and you 're both in bed and your son comes home through the door and says mum !
dad !
-- we 've got to fit it in between the children , ' he said .
` four of them live with me and although it 's a massive house it 's very noisy .
we go to florida three or four times a year and that 's probably when i get my leg over the most .
' stewart , who has two children with third wife miss lancaster and a further six with former partners , also revealed that domestic life at the couple 's beverly hills home involves chores , cleaning and the school run -- albeit with a bit more glamour than most of us can muster .
he admitted his children were too embarrassed to be driven to school in his ferrari , so he now drops them off in a rolls royce .
in a remarkably frank interview with american radio personality howard stern , stewart said : ` i 'm up at 7.30 every morning , i drive the kids to school in the rolls .
i love my rolls royce .
' i used to take sean in my ferrari and he hated it .
he 'd say `` please do n't stop right outside the school '' but i would .
