harry redknapp is refusing to lift the lid on the england ` refuseniks ' after three lions captain steven gerrard ordered the qpr boss to name and shame the players who he claimed have feigned injury to avoid international duty .
redknapp had told radio 5 live at the weekend that when he was tottenham boss some players had asked him to pull them out of england squads .
the claim , however , riled gerrard after he admitted he was ` broken ' by england 's failure to get out of the group stages .

staying quiet : qpr boss harry redknapp wo n't name the players who used to avoid playing for england .
not impressed : england captain steven gerrard wants redknapp to name the players involved .
` i tell you what , i 'd be interested to find out who those players are , ' said gerrard .
` if harry is making a comment like that , he should name them and embarrass them .
no one in this group wants to go home .
no one wants to go home .
` if he 's not naming them , i ca n't answer that .
if it 's the case , it 's disgusting .
for me , if a player does n't want to be , he does n't deserve to be here at a world cup .
the comment is a comment , like ` them ' .
` they ' did n't want to play for england .
who ?
name them ?
is it aaron lennon , kyle walker , andros townsend ?
` i do n't know who he means .
five years ago ?
10 years ago ?
i 've spoken to jermain defoe and he 's devastated .
` i can understand why you 've asked the question , with harry redknapp a big coach in the game , but we need names .
we need names .
but it 's not here .
i can guarantee it 's not here .
` he should be embarrassed if there 's one player .
when you go down into the younger age groups , they 're younger lads .
` they might not want to be away from their families
