a long island man with no patience for traffic jams has won $ 5 million after stopping to buy some lottery tickets on his way home from work to pass the time until a bumper-to-bumper back-up cleared .
thomas mainella , 62 , an electrician from melville , pulled over after hitting a road detour in plainview and bought six set for life scratch-off tickets from sunny 's cards and gifts .
he decided to scratch all six at the store but never made it past the fifth .
` i 'm a winner !
' : thomas mainella -lrb- center -rrb- with his girlfriend donna -lrb- right -rrb- .
' i scratched that and it said `` life '' and i just went `` i 'm a freaking winner !
' mainella told fox and friends .
mainella is a longtime lottery player and always imagined his numbers would come up .
` i 've always told people i 'm going to win big on this game .
they all thought i was crazy , ' he told the new york state lottery .
mainella said he 's always fantasized that if he won , he 'd rent a limo to drive to his girlfriend donna , pick her up and tell her he 'd won the lottery .
unfortunately , he was unable to rent a limo at such short notice , so he drove himself home - presumably not even annoyed at the traffic jam .
big plans : mainella and his girlfriend are planning to have a much more elaborate wedding than they could have afforded before the win .
' i called six different companies that day and no one could send a limo on such short notice so i called her at work and told her to come home right away .
' mainella greeted donna at the front door and asked , ` do you believe in me ?
' when donna said that she did , he told her ` you 're gon na be happy for the rest of your life .
' mainella has elected to take his $ 5 million in 20 installments of $ 172,000 per year .
