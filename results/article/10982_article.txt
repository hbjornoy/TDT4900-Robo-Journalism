scandal-plagued welfare-to-work provider , a4e has managed to get just 3.5 per cent of its jobseekers into long-term roles .
fewer than four out of 100 unemployed people who have gone through the firm have secured jobs that last more than 13 weeks .
almost 115,000 jobseekers were referred to a4e in the ten months to may 2012 under the government 's work programme .
of those , just 4,020 secured jobs that lasted more than three months , according to a channel 4 news investigation .
the company has already been hit by damaging allegations of fraud .
its chairman , emma harrison , who paid herself an # 8.6 million dividend in 2011 despite a4e 's dreadful record , was forced to quit earlier this year .
the figures show that a4e - the second biggest provider of the work programme - is failing to meet its targets in the first year .
it has to get 5.5 per cent of its jobseekers into sustainable roles every year to keep its contract .
the ` expert ' firm has even struggled to secure real jobs for applicants in the olympic borough of newham in east london , trailing behind even the local council .
while the borough has secured 5000 sustainable jobs through its own job support scheme , a4e has managed to get just 92 people out of 2,837 participants , into sustainable jobs .
the company also has contracts to help jobseekers in merseyside , the east midlands , south yorkshire , lancashire , the thames valley area and south yorkshire .
in the thames valley area , just 2.8 per cent of jobseekers secured long term roles while in east london , just 3.3 per cent got jobs that lasted more than 13 weeks .
worrying : the ` expert ' firm has even struggled to secure real jobs for applicants in the olympic borough of newham in east london , trailing behind even the local council .
