a 21-year-old mother-of-two died of flu four days after her baby daughter was delivered via emergency c-section .
nikki westgarth never got to meet eva rose westgarth-burrell , who was born on february 4 .
lying in a critical condition in hospital , doctors made the decision to deliver her unborn child via c-section .
but four days later miss westgarth lost her life to the common illness .
her mother kim hannant is now bringing up eva and her older brother jake grimes , four .
the 57-year-old is now calling for all women in at-risk groups to ensure they have a yearly flu jab - an injection that could have saved her daughter .
it was shortly after christmas last year that miss westgarth began to feel tired and run down .
but mrs hannant said the family just attributed it to her being pregnant .
` then just after new year , the whole family came down with the flu , ' she said .
' i have asthma and i 've had my jab for the last 10 years , so did n't suffer as much as everybody else .
` nikki lived next door to us , and she came in and complained that she felt like she was dying .
' i thought she was joking , but she was so concerned that she went to hospital , but was n't admitted .
` the next day she was still very concerned so went to hospital , who admitted her to maternity .
` once the family were given the all clear from flu , we were able to visit her .
she was in good spirits , but said she was in a bit of pain .
however whilst i was there , she said she 'd started to cough up blood .
` after helping her out of bed to go to the toilet i went to help one of the nurses with some paperwork , and when i came back i could n't find nikki .
