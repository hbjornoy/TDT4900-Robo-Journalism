philip hammond has questioned david cameron 's desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid .
speaking on a trip to ebola-stricken sierra leone , the foreign secretary said yesterday he saw no reason to pass a law that says 0.7 per cent of britain 's national income has to go on aid ` because we have met it already ' .

philip hammond has questioned david cameron 's desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid .
