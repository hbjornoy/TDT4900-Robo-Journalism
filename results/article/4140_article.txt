a british grandmother drowned after being swept away by a freak wave during an exotic luxury holiday in india .
jane whittington , 58 , was on a four-month break in the resort of goa with her partner steve cooper when the tragedy hit .
and sadly , the former carer never got to meet her newborn granddaughter , betsy , who arrived while she was on her dream holiday .
ms whittington , from birley , sheffield , and her partner , as well as her sister and brother-in-law , who were also on the trip , had been out a boat for a fishing trip before having a beach massage .
she then decided to cool off with a dip in the sea with mr cooper , but got into difficulty and was carried out by a freak wave .
mr cooper battled the rough conditions to rescue ms whittington , and tried in vain to save her .
the couple were due to return home this weekend , but instead she was cremated in goa earlier this week .
paying tribute , her family said they were devastated at the loss of ms whittington , who ` lived life to the full ' .
daughter donna mcgrail , 40 , son max ellis , 37 and five grandchildren , are now planning to return later in the year to scatter her ashes .
mr ellis 's partner kirstie barber , said : ` all we know is she had a lovely day on a fishing trip , had a massage on a beach , went swimming and then a wave took her .
` steve managed to get her out of the water but could not save her .
' the former carer never got to meet her newborn granddaughter , who arrived while she was on her four-month dream holiday with her partner steve cooper , sister and brother-in-law .
the couple were on holiday in the same resort they had visited for years , which ms whittington called her ` second home ' .
ms barber added : ` she loved it over there , she called it her second home and each time she went she stayed for longer and longer .
