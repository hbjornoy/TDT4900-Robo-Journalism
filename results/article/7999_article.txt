an australian woman who paid # 800 for two new apple iphones lost her money when she opened the boxes - and found two real green apples inside .
the 21-year-old brisbane woman had placed an advertisement in an online buy-and-sell site saying she was looking to purchase a number of iphones .
police in the queensland town of upper mt gravatt , near brisbane , said that not long after the advert was placed in the gumtree site a woman called and said she had two apples for sale .
the 21-year-old placed an advert online saying she was looking for two apple iphones , but was sold two apples .
senior constable jess hopkin of the upper mt gravatt crime prevention unit said the two women arranged to meet at a mcdonald 's outlet , where the transaction took place .
the purchaser handed over $ 1500 , the equivalent of # 800 , and was given two new iphone boxes in return , the quest community newspaper of queensland reported today .
her mistake was to not look inside .
on returning home the young woman opened the boxes and found to her horror that they contained real apples .
senior constable hopkin warned people to be wary when they buy anything online .
` do n't stay away because most people are doing the right thing - but be smart about what you buy , ' she said .
` if something seems too good to be true , it probably is .
it 's really just common sense .
' on returning home the young woman opened the boxes and found to her horror that they contained real apples .
commentators writing on an online site were n't letting the buyer off the hook with their criticism .
' i do n't know anyone that would hand over $ 1500 to a stranger without checking the item , ' wrote one man .
` besides , you can buy a brand new iphone5 for $ 700 .
so if this is a true story then i 'm sorry but she deserved it !
' a woman asked : ` and she went to the police ?? seriously , i 'd be too embarrassed to go to the police if i 'd been that stupid .
