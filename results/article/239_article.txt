betrayed : beverley neville found out her husband of 13 years was living a double life .
beverley neville used to be thankful for her chauffeur husband who worked all the hours he could to pay the mortgage on the house they shared in welwyn garden city , hertfordshire , after she was made redundant .
beverley , 58 , believed that husband , raymond , 55 , often had to stay away from home as he worked night shifts and was regularly hired to drive to cardiff .
but she was shocked to discover her husband of 13 years was not the man she thought he was .
in fact , many of the times he had stayed away ` working ' he was actually seeing another woman .
and beverley was stunned to find out he was n't just having an affair - he had committed bigamy by marrying the other woman after forging divorce papers .
recalling the events that led to her shocking discovery on today 's this morning , beverley said : ` one of the times he told me he was away in wales i became worried because i could n't get hold of him for ten days .
his mobile kept going straight to answerphone .
' i had started working as a carer then and by coincidence , the son of one of the ladies i looked after worked at the same chauffeur company .
i asked him to try and contact raymond and he did - on a different number to the one i had .
` raymond was living a double life and had two mobile phones and he was n't in wales , he was in china .
' beverley confronted her husband when he returned home but he denied everything .
he said his work was ` top secret ' so he could n't tell her where he had been .
` oh so you 're pinocchio working for mi5 now ?
' she retorted at the time .
suspicious of what he had been up to , beverley later checked her husband 's emails - which she had access to , as she did his invoicing for him .
this was how she discovered he was married to a chinese nurse , april chang , who he had set up home with less than 20 miles away
