rapper drake performed in new york last night - and , contrary to rumours beforehand , he was not arrested over his role in a vicious nightclub brawl with chris brown .
however , the notorious fight did make an impact on drake 's long island show on saturday , as he appeared to refer to his troubles twice during his set .
the concert came as it emerged that the nightclub where drake and brown fought over r&b star rihanna , sending several injured people to hospital , has been closed ` indefinitely ' .

performance : drake managed to get through his new york concert without being apprehended by police .
drake performed at the jones beach theater in the town of wantagh , and opened his set by saying : ` when i woke up this morning , i had to think about a lot of things .
' but he continued : ` but the only thing i gave a f *** about was that i was in new york city tonight , ' according to the daily news .
later in the set , he seemed to make another reference to wednesday night 's scuffle , when he said : ` it 's last call and you 're really too drunk to give a f *** .
' a n ***** in the corner is standing there looking at you funny .
you bump elbows with him on the way to the bathroom , but really there 's only one n ***** that you got to think about .
' nypd sources had suggested that the star could be arrested at the concert if he did not turn himself in , but by the time the evening came around there was no sign that he would be taken into custody .
meanwhile it was reported by tmz that w.i.p. , the nightclub in new york 's soho district , has been shut down indefinitely over a number of violations apparently unrelated to the a-list brawl .
earlier a second bystander released photos of her injuries that were a result of the flying bottles during the fight
