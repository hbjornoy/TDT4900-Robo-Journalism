remote russian roads do n't have rules , you 've just got to reach the other end .
and in this amusing video , one daring driver decides to play chicken - with a tank .
singing ` we are going to crash head on , go , ' as he approaches the behemoth of a tank , it 's really heart-in-the-mouth stuff .
the driver is full of confidence that he will win this game of ` chicken ' with the army tank .
and he is proved right , as the tank turns sharply off the dirt track and onto the scrubland .
the tank makes a turn just in time as this shot shows how close the two came to a crash .
but some 20 or so yards ahead , the truck takes a left , and out of the way of the brave -lrb- and perhaps a little erratic -rrb- car driver .
` ha , scared , ' yelps a more-than-pleased driver , before uttering the word of the game we all knew he was playing ; ` chicken .
