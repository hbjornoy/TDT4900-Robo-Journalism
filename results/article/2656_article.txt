banana milkshakes in the pool with his wife and chess on the beach at sunset with his dad ... these are n't exactly the images that come to mind when asked to picture a getaway fit for rock 'n roll royalty .
but that 's exactly how mcfly , and now mcbusted , star , harry judd , likes it .
the drummer enjoyed a new year break with wife of two years , izzy , and his parents , emma and christopher , at the inn at english harbour in antigua and shared his holiday snaps exclusively with mailonline .

mcfly , and now mcbusted , star , harry judd , enjoyed banana milkshakes in the pool with his wife during their getaway to the inn at english harbour in antigua .
the pair stayed for 10 days in the exclusive resort , which has only 28 adults-only rooms and is set on a private beach .
the sumptuous resort , set on a sprawling 19 acres , is as private as it is luxurious with just 28 rooms and its own private beach .
and while there are a host of outdoor pursuits to be enjoyed , sun , sand and good company were all the popstar really needed .
` we 're the worst couple in the world for activities , ' judd told mailonline travel .
` my idea of a good time on holiday is lying about on the bed , on the beach , reading a book , maybe a round of golf - these are all of my requirements .
and izzy 's on the same page too .
' the pair were regular , rather photogenic , fixtures poolside where harry says they enjoyed virgin cocktails - ` usually a banana milkshake , before going back for some more reading .
' while the words ` virgin cocktail ' can often see ears prick up about the potential pitter patter of tiny feet , this couple - who were married in december 2012 , insist that there 's nothing to share .
they simply do n't drink .
though there were plenty of activities to choose from , judd admits that he and his wife prefer to lounge on the beach .
though the pair has no aversion to kids per se , the resort is adults
