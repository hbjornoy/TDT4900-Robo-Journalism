two hero bin men today told how they rescued a terrified woman and her dog from a sinking car - after she drove off a 20ft harbour wall and plunged into the sea .
derek main , 35 , and gary roberts , 43 , were eating their lunch at burghead harbour in moray when they heard a loud revving noise followed by a massive splash .
the duo fled to the water 's edge to find the shocked woman and her dog trapped in a brand new vauxhall corsa .
sunk : the vehicle flew into the water after a woman drove off a 20ft wall and plunged into the sea .
mystery : it is not yet clear what happened to lead to the red vauxhall flying into the sea , but thankfully there were no injuries .
while derek ran for some ropes , gary swam into the harbour with a mystery irish cyclist who said he was a lifeguard and freed the panicking woman , thought to be in her 50s , from the stricken vehicle .
derek , of lossiemouth , recalled the bizarre incident which happened 12.20 pm on thursday afternoon .
he said : ` we were at the harbour having our lunch .
we saw a person sitting in the car and we thought she was taking in the view , which is not unusual .
` but suddenly there was an almighty revving sound and the car shot into the water .
' gary ran down the slipway and began swimming out to the car , while the irish man , who would only give his name as paddy , stripped off and dived 20ft off the pier into the water .
with the car being washed out to sea and already submerged in water as deep as 12ft , the men had to act quickly .
brave lads : derek main , left , and gary roberts , right , beside burghead harbour where they saved a woman driver and her dog .
gary , 43 , of nearby lhanbryde , said : ` derek took his boots off , but i went straight in with all my gear on .
