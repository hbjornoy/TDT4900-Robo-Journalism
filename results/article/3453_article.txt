back home , when luis suarez did what we always knew luis suarez would do , 50 million englishmen would have given everything to wipe that smile off his face .
sadly , the 11 on the pitch in the arena sao paulo did not have the same idea .
you could even make a case that they had no idea .
england 's defence was dysfunctional and disorganised , brutally exposed at the very highest level of the game .
suarez picked them off , scoring two magnificent goals on a magical night for his country .
good for him .
england were petrified by his sheer presence on the field after five weeks out through injury .
yes he 's world class and yes it 's your job to stop him .
video scroll down to watch suarez 's emotional dressing room message for wife and kids .
tormentor : luis suarez was the star of the show as uruguay beat england in sao paulo .
helpless : england 's defence had no answer to a top-class striker for the second game in a row .
too hot to handle : italy 's mario balotelli posed england with a lot of problems in manaus .
england 's defending for the uruguay 's opening goal was abject , a depressing re-run of mario balotelli 's header in manaus on saturday .
allowing suarez to run through unchecked to score their winner five minutes from time is worthy of an fa inquiry .
what were they doing ?
maybe we will never know .
the fa will be willing the country to forgive and forget , to learn from our mistakes so that we can all be one big happy family at the next tournament .
no chance , not after this .
england are as good as out of the world cup in brazil and that is unacceptable .
roy hodgson has blown this .
big time .
every time phil jagielka made a mistake in the first half , a uruguayan player was all over him .
cavani , suarez , rodriguez ... take your pick .
if your name is franco baresi or franz beckenbauer then you 've earned the right to pull out the cruyff turn on the halfway line when there is n't a covering defender .
you do n't try that sort of stunt
