rickie lambert smiled when it was pointed out that his england strike rate is akin to gary lineker 's .

sharp shooter : rickie lambert took his england tally to three from five games with a strike against ecuador .

it 's something we 've practised all our lives .
there are still aspects i want to improve and do better .
` it 's getting to know your players as well .
