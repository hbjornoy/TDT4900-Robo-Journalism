everton striker samuel eto'o is so famous even his team-mates were a little bit starstruck when he first arrived at goodison park .
eto'o , 33 , has only made two substitutes appearances ahead of sunday 's clash with crystal palace but it has n't stopped the former real madrid , barcelona , inter milan and chelsea superstar making his mark .
` i must say when he first signed and came into training , it was a bit `` that 's samuel eto'o there !
'' admitted forward steven naismith .
steven naismith has been impressed with samuel eto'o since the cameroonian sealed a move to the toffees .
eto'o joined everton on a free transfer after being deemed surplus to requirements by former side chelsea .
the everton striker will be hoping to get on the scoresheet against crystal palace on sunday .
` he 's won a fair few things in his career , it 's surreal when you list them all .
people questioned him after not playing as much at chelsea last season but he still scored a fair amount of goals for the amount of game time he had .
` in the short time he has been here , he has shown his class .
he knows how to play the lone striker role or how to play with a striker .
` he is a presence who knows when to wait for runners as you saw with his assist for kevin mirallas on thursday night .
he is a fantastic signing for us and a massive asset .
' the cameroon striker won two champions league crowns and three la liga titles with barca before landing the treble for jose mourinho 's inter milan in 2010 .
he will also prove his worth with everton who are now in a run of seven matches in three weeks .
naismith added : ` that is where the boys that are n't playing still need to work hard as they are still going to be used .
