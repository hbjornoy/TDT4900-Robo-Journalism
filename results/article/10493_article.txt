catherine kieu , pictured , is accused of drugging her husband , tying him up , and cutting off his penis with a knife .
a man has told a court how his wife drugged him before cutting off his penis with one slash of a knife and throwing it in the garbage disposal .
the 60-year-old man , whose penis was too mangled to reattached but who had surgery so he could urinate , told the court : ` she murdered me that night .
' his ex-wife , catherine kieu , 50 , is accused of severing his penis because she was angry that he had started seeing a former lover and wanted a divorce .
on the first day of the trial yesterday , deputy district attorney john christl said that kieu had bugged her house in a bid to catch her husband cheating on her with an old flame .
the bugs found nothing , although they did record the attack kieu is said to have committed on her 60-year-old husband .
mr christl said kieu laced her husband 's tofu soup with insomnia drug zolpidem on the evening of july 11 , 2011 , while they were both at their marital home in garden grove , southeast of los angeles .
he said audio footage picked up the husband complimenting her on the soup , before going to bed , early , at 8.10 pm .
kieu is then alleged to have waited until he was asleep before tying him to the bed and cutting off his penis with a ten-inch kitchen knife .
the husband , who is known only by his first name in court , said he remembered waking up tied to the bed .
mr christl said : ` when he woke , she told him `` you deserve it '' three times , and then slices off his penis with one motion of the knife ' , reported news.com.au .
` she then walks into the kitchen , takes the severed penis , and puts it into the garbage disposal .
' he told the court that after she put the penis in the garbage disposal , she then turned it on ,
