after losing two straight home games heading into a tilt as the away team at wembley against the jacksonville jaguars on sunday , dallas cowboys players were happy to see quarterback tony romo back at practice on thursday .
besides romo himself , perhaps no one was happier than wide receiver dez bryant .
the fifth-year pro , who called romo 's return ` very exciting ' , said : ` it was like he never left .
we had a great day of practice .
it was real good .
we 're just going to move forward and see what happens on sunday .
' ` it always helps whenever tony 's out there .
he 's our guy .
he 's our leader .
whenever he 's out there it makes everybody feel that much more comfortable .
he know how to lead us in the right direction and that 's what he 's gon na do on sunday .
' tony romo could return to the dallas cowboys starting line-up .
the nfl 's leading rusher , demarco murray , was glad to see romo moving ` like he always does ' in his return to the field .
` it was good to see him back out there , ' said the 26-year-old .
` i thought he did well today .
it 's always good to have your leader out there .
we 're excited to have him back .
' not having romo throwing passes may have had an impact earlier in the week , but practising outside of the us was n't really an issue .
bryant said : .
` i do n't think we 've missed a beat .
i was telling the guys , i do n't know if it 's london or the air , but i 'm flying .
everybody else is flying around too .
i got a little extra juice .
' murray , who has 1,133 rushing yards this season , agreed the workouts at allianz park have been beneficial .
he said : .
` we 've had two good days of practise .
the mood is great .
obviously we have n't been playing as expected individually or as a collective group .
we 've moved on .
we 've learned from the mistakes we made and the things we did well .
