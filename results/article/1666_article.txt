a romanian man who found what could be the oldest forged coins in history while out treasure hunting with his son says he will use his fortune to ` buy a new metal detector ' .
paul croituru , 37 , dug up the trove of 300 forged silver coins worth nearly # 120,000 - more than ten times what he earns a year as a council worker .
but the father , who found the ancient greek coins with the help of son alexandru , 13 , immediately told the authorities and will now lose nearly all of the money because of local treasure hunting rules .
despite being forgeries of the 2,350-year-old tetradrachm currency , experts say each 5mm penny is worth # 400 .
the haul of 309 whole coins and 40 fragments is worth around # 120,000 , according to currency experts .
paul croituru , 37 , found the ancient greek forged coins near the site of a medieval village in northern romania .
the father and son found 309 whole coins believed to be worth # 400 each , as well as 40 fragments of the forged currency , but went straight to the authorities with their haul .
they are believed to be the oldest counterfeit coins ever found , and were produced just 400 years after the first ever coins were made .
the pair are now likely to receive # 12,000 - just 10 per cent of the estimated total value of the forged coins - while the rest goes to the government .
mr croituru said : ` it is still more than i earn in a year from my job but i have never done this for money .
` there are those in the area that say i was foolish not to have kept the lot , and could easily have sold them abroad with nobody any the wiser .
` but my son would have known , and what sort of an example is that for a boy to get from his father ?
i do n't have any regrets .
' i thought to be an example for my son .
he is passionate about history .
mr croituru said they were using an old metal detector that was worth around # 120 when he bought it , but
