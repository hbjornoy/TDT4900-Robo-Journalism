she put her cat 's extraordinary long life down to lots of treats and regular walks with her pet dog , and said : ' i do n't throw big birthday parties for her , because every day she is around is a celebration .

it 's quite a milestone .

' apart from a touch of arthritis in her old age , cola has always been as fit as a fiddle .
mrs goldsmith , who has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren , said : ` she has been lucky and not really had many close shaves or problems .
