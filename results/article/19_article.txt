these two screen grabs show you just how hard man-marking is -- and how bad manchester united were at it for didier drogba 's goal .
in the first image , all the chelsea players are picked up .
a split second later and drogba , john terry , branislav ivanovic and oscar are all unmarked .
unless you are physically holding somebody -- as united did earlier in the game -- it is impossible to man-mark someone from a setpiece .
the attacker has the advantage and if you switch off for a moment , you are in trouble .
that 's why i favour zonal marking .
chelsea 's major aerial threats are marked before their corner ahead of the opening goal on sunday .
but as the ball comes in , chelsea 's aerial threats are all in open space and drogba scores .
and having 5ft 8in rafael marking 6ft 2in drogba is criminal .
louis van gaal says marouane fellaini is to blame as he was supposed to be marking him but the players should be in no doubt .
ironically , it was the man who was supposed to be marking the space who is most to blame for the goal .
robin van persie 's position is far too deep , he should be nearer the six-yard line , ready to attack the ball .
instead , when it comes in , he melts away towards the goal-line rather than attacking the ball .
at arsenal we used to put patrick vieira in that area as it would take an incredible ball to get past him .
united might have to rethink positioning van persie there .
drogba jumps high above rafael to head the ball towards goal and score the opener for chelsea .
