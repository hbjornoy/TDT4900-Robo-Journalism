winner : kristen stewart has been declared the world 's best-dressed woman .
she often seems happier in scruffy jeans and trainers than a posh frock .
but it seems kristen stewart still has a few fashion lessons for her british contemporaries .
the tomboy american actress has been declared the world 's best-dressed woman , ahead of harry potter star emma watson and the duchess of cambridge .
it is the second year in a row miss stewart has topped the annual fashion list compiled by glamour magazine .
the 23-year-old twilight star was praised for her ` personal rock-chick style ' .
although she sometimes embraces high fashion on the red carpet , she often dresses down in her free time .
she once admitted she can sometimes be found wanting in the fashion stakes , saying : ` i go outside , and i 'm wearing a funky t-shirt and my hair is dirty , and people say , `` what 's wrong with her ?
she needs to invest in a hairbrush '' .
miss watson , also 23 , remained in second place .
in recent years she has ditched her innocent image as a child star with a series of sultry photoshoots and risqu√© film roles .
however , she has admitted struggling to look sexy in the past , saying : .
` i find the whole concept of being ` sexy ' embarrassing and confusing .
` if .
i do a photo-shoot people desperately want to change me - dye my hair .
blonder , pluck my eyebrows , give me a fringe .
` then there 's the .
choice of clothes .
' i know everyone wants a picture of me in a .
mini-skirt .
` but that 's not me .
i feel uncomfortable .
i 'd never go out in .
a mini-skirt .
` it 's nothing to do with protecting the hermione image .
i .
would n't do that .
` personally , i do n't actually think it 's even that .
sexy .
