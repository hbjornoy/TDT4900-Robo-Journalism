a couple who neglected their dogs to the point of near-death face a jail sentence .
victoria sams , 35 and her husband david , 38 , from meadowfield , co durham , pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at darlington magistrates court .
their two dogs were found in such poor health they had to be put down by the rspca .
the images show the weak and starving dogs in their last days .
a veterinary examination rated both dogs ' body condition at the worst possible .
serious neglect : one of the dogs cowers in the corner of a wooden kennel with no bedding .
the dogs , ebby , a collie cross and kizzy , a rottweiler , had been living in an outdoor kennel and pen with no bedding and surrounded by faeces .
rspca officers found ebby to be so emaciated and riddled with arthritis that she was unable to stand .
kizzy had a piece of bone wedged in her mouth which prevented her from eating , causing a tetanus infection .
a veterinary examination rated both dogs ' body condition at level one ; on a scale of one to nine with one being the worst .
emaciated : the dog has a protruding ribcage and matted fur .
the dogs were said to be in severe pain from arthritis .
their muscles were so wasted , they struggled to stand .
kevin campbell , prosecuting for the rspca , said that when inspectors arrived at the couple 's home they found kizzy in a ` collapsed and almost rigid state ' .
he said : ` the dog was struggling to breathe ; it would die without immediate vet 's attention .
' mr campbell said that officers returned to collect 16-year-old ebby , who was later found to be suffering from an organ ailment known as cushing 's disease .
mr campbell said : ` she -lrb- ebby -rrb- would have been in severe pain and had muscle wastage and arthritis .
` she should have been on pain relief long before the vet saw her .
' the dog would have died within a few days .
