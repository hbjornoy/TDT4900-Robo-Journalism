mark hughes has backed the fa 's probe into garry monk and insisted that victor moses is no cheat .
the stoke manager also said he hoped officials would not have their impression of his winger swayed by the media attention .
monk has been asked for an explanation of his comments following swansea 's defeat to stoke on sunday , where he raged at moses for alleged diving and claimed referee michael oliver had cheated his side .
garry monk -lrb- left -rrb- was furious about a penalty given against his side , calling victor moses -lrb- right -rrb- ' a cheat ' mark hughes -lrb- above -rrb- supports the football association 's decision to ask monk about his comments .
oliver awarded stoke a penalty when moses fell under contact from angel rangel in the area .
stoke chairman peter coates made a complaint to the fa about monk 's accusations .
` it 's right that the fa have to ask for garry 's comments , ' said hughes .
` i made my feelings known at the end of the game .
we have a strongly held view .
` now it 's up to them whether to take it further .
it 's disappointing as it overshadowed our performance .
moses won a penalty following a challenge from swansea 's angel rangel -lrb- right -rrb- , earning stoke a 1-1 draw .
` garry 's a very articulate young man and on this occasion maybe used the wrong words .
that can happen .
victor said he felt contact and was impeded , just as i thought .
' hughes insisted the furore should not dictate observer 's impressions of the 23-year-old -- including referees .
` victor is a very strong-minded player and will get on with business of playing well for stoke city , ' he said .
` i hope this week does n't shape people 's view of him .
what was said of him was n't correct .
