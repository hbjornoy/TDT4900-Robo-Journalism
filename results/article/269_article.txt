england stalwart peter reid has called upon liverpool 's jordan henderson to be given the key role of becoming roy hodgon 's long-term holding midfielder -- rather than jack wilshere .
reid believes finding the right `` destroyer '' is the biggest question left for hodgson after the 2-0 win in switzerland .
man in the middle : jordan henderson should be england 's holding midfielder , according to peter reid .
shadow : henderson keeps tabs on switzerland 's admir mehmedi on monday night .
he admitted : ` i am not sure about wilshere in the holding midfield role .
` we have good forward players like ross barkley and adam lallana to come back but at the other end , when phil jones lost the ball at 0-0 , if we were against top quality opposition , we would have been 1-0 down .
` that extra defensive shield is my one area of concern but we have time to improve on that .
i think henderson could go in there , he has great leg and could do a job .
' speaking out : former sunderland boss reid was talking at the soccerex global convention .
reid 's 1986 world cup team-mate bryan robson agreed as they spoke at the soccerex global convention in manchester .
` i think you have to be good defensively to play that holding midfield role .
can wilshere do that ?
