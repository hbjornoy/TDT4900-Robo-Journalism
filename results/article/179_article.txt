down : the shocking accident was filmed by the homeowner as mr weir was buried under tonnes of bricks .
the former paratrooper underwent a six-hour operation after the horror accident last june , which saw surgeons drill metal pins into the ligaments and tendons in his shredded limb .
mr weir was taken to nottingham 's queen 's medical centre after the accident , where doctors told him he would probably need his leg amputated - but one year on , he is amazingly now back at work .
he said : ` i remember the wall exploding and hitting me in the face .
i was still conscious and i looked up and thought i 've got to get out of here .
honestly , i thought i was gone , i thought that was it .
` i thought i was going to die , but when i saw the dust settle on the bricks and realised i was still alive my adrenaline kicked in and i started to drag myself out of the mess .
