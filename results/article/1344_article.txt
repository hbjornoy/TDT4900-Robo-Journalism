andre ward has hinted he has no plans to cross the atlantic for a potential rematch against carl froch .
both men hold different versions of the wba super-middleweight title and have been ordered to fight by the organisation .
froch called on ward to travel outside of america for the first time in his career and face him at nottingham forest 's city ground .
american andre ward -lrb- left -rrb- belittled talks of a united kingdom rematch with nottingham fighter carl froch .
froch -lrb- left -rrb- said it was ward 's turn to make the trip across the atlantic after he travelled to fight in atlantic city .
the cobra called on ward to ` travel out of his comfort zone ' but the american is proving difficult to convince .
but the unbeaten californian tweeted : ` looks like frochy froch remembered my name all of a sudden .
that 's good to know .
looks like the old man is still kicking .
` froch could have gotten this fight years ago , but it took the wba mandating the fight for him to step up .
smh -lrb- shaking my head -rrb- .
this guy .
` if this fight does happen , froch is not dictating anything .
he must have fell and bumped his head .
' ward has fought just twice since he comprehensively outpointed froch in atlantic city in 2011 .
froch leans on the ropes during his bout against ward in their wba/wbc super middleweight battle in 2011 .
and the cobra said earlier this week : ' ` i fought him in the us .
now it 's only right that he comes over here .
to be a truly great champion you have to box overseas .
` ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone .
' i dare him .
he will discover that i 'm a very different animal here than i was that night on the boardwalk .
' the two men have until the beginning of april to agree a deal before purse bids are ordered with the fight taking place within 120 days .
