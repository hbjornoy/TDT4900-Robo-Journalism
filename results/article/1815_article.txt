for years women have been convinced that porn star style waxing and vajazzles are the quickest way to impress their other halves in bed , with nearly two thirds saying that their look down below is calculated to please their man .
but it appears that it 's time to wave goodbye to painful waxing for good , after a new survey found that men actually prefer a natural look .
according to the poll , which canvassed 1,000 men , the most popular look is is ` trimmed and tidy ' -- a far cry from the hollywood , which involves having all hair removed .
au naturel : contrary to what the majority of women believe , men prefer a natural approach to grooming .
nearly half -lrb- 43 per cent -rrb- of those who took part in the survey , which was commissioned by waxing brand , nads , said they preferred their women to look as natural as possible but with a ` bermuda triangle ' - trimmed hair and waxed edges leaving no bikini hair overspill .
17 per cent plumped for the brazilian , a landing strip of pubic hair , while 15 per cent liked the heart shaped ` heart breaker ' .
just 12 per cent chose the full hollywood , with most men saying they preferred their women to have some hair ` down there ' .
the style that men hated the most was the ' g wax ' -- a closely trimmed small square of hair that most felt looked a bit silly and a bit of a turn off .
among the men who took part in the poll was sidcup father of two , mark tailworth , who said : ` i 'd hate my wife not to have some hair , i much prefer her to be well trimmed than sporting some ridiculous , unsexy design .
' ouch !
the bejewelled vajazzle was popularised by amy childs , star of the only way is essex .
others , including 27-year-old daniel smith from essex , said that they did enjoy seeing the odd hollywood or vajazzle on their girlfriends .
