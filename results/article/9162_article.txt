the u.s. bureau of land management has withdrawn a permit allowing a pro-hunting group to hold a wolf and coyote shooting derby on public land in idaho .
the agency canceled the permit last night , after it was issued nov. 13 to idaho for wildlife that provided use of about 3 million acres of federal land for the three-day event in early january .
the agency says the group modified the derby 's rules , making it unclear if the permit still applied .
the derby would have seen an unlimited number of wolves and other animals killed by hunters .
derby organizers say the agency caved in to environmental groups but that the event will still be held on u.s. forest service land and private ranches in the east-central part of the state near salmon .
the blm faced two federal lawsuits from conservation groups contending the agency violated environmental laws in issuing the permit .
groups claimed the hunt on public lands was ` not in the public interest ' .
' ` blm 's first-ever approval of a wolf-killing derby on public lands undermines wolf recovery in the northern rockies and was not in the public interest ' , director of litigation at advocates for the west , laird lucas , said .
hundreds of hunters could have been involved in the derby which would kill wolves , skunks , weasels , starlings , raccoon , coyotes and jackrabbits , the guardian reported .
a press release showed more than 100,000 comments from environmental groups criticizing the derby .
