camilo villegas produced a sparkling eight-under-par 63 to claim the first-round lead in the wyndham championship at sedgefield country club in greensboro , north carolina .
americans william mcgirt and webb simpson - the 2011 wyndham champion - must have thought they had done enough to head into day two of the final regular event of the pga tour season at least top of the pile , but colombian villegas had other ideas .
villegas started as he meant to go on with a birdie at the 10th - his first hole of the day - and went on to add four more birdies and a brilliant eagle three at the par-five fifth to highlight a flawless opening round .
leader : camillo villegas on top at greensboro after first day round of 63 .
daylight : he shot eight-under-par at the wyndham championship to lead by two shots .
england 's paul casey , scotland 's martin laird and american trio scott langley , heath slocum and andrew loupe were two shots off the pace after signing for 65s .
villegas was delighted with his start to the tournament .
` it was nice to go without bogeys and i think it probably showed it was a consistent round , ' said the colombian .
` kept it in the fairway , kept it on the greens and just made the putts when i hit it close .
... i just hit the ball nicely .
