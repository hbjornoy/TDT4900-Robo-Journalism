mr swanson told key-tv3 that he was ` lucky to be alive , no doubt about that ' , following the attack on sunday .
mr swanson said the shark attack would n't keep him out of the water , saying : ` as soon as the doctor gives me the green light i 'll be going back out there and i 'll probably be hesitant to paddle out to the same spot , but i 'll eventually be out there as well .
' he said the moment he was pulled under the water , ` everything changed dramatically ' .
` it went from calm , serene , beautiful day with your friends to violent .
' mr swason estimated the shark dragged him about 5-10 feet below the surface .
