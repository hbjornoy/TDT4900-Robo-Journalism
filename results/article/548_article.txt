bernie ecclestone has said that qatar 's extravagant plans to host a formula one grand prix could be thwarted by a handshake deal he did with the country 's middle eastern neighbours , bahrain .
despite qatar unveiling images of a proposed new street circuit in lusail , the city that has been named as the venue for the final of the 2022 football world cup , ecclestone said : ` there is a problem .
` when i did the deal to have a race in bahrain i shook hands with them -- promising not to have another race in the area unless they agreed to it .

` then abu dhabi came along and said they wanted a race .
i said i could n't help them unless bahrain agree to let them join the calendar .
if they agreed , fine .
they did agree .
` now bahrain needs to agree to a race in qatar .
if that can be sorted , fine .
if not , we ca n't do anything about it .

qatar hope to run an f1 race in 2016 , and failing that in 2017 .
they have built good links with the fia over the last few years as shown when the sport 's official end-of-season gala awards dinner was staged there last month .
but bahrain have indicated that they are not keen to acquiesce to qatar 's proposed entry .
'm y personal opinion of having another race -- wherever it is -- i do n't think we are ready for that , ' said bahrain 's f1 chief executive sheikh salman bin isa al khalifa .
