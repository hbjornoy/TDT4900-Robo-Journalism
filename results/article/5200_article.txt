police are investigating a ` rod rage ' attack after a fisherman was left with a hook in his face when he was targeted by a rival angler .
nathan ould , 39 , was sitting in his boat when the barb was cast towards him and pierced his cheek in a row over mackerel .
detectives say the culprit meant to hit him and positioned himself at hope 's nose , in torquay , devon so mr ould was within reach .
the attacker then fled with the rest of his angling equipment and left his victim needing medical treatment to remove the metal hook from his left cheek .
brutal : nathan ould was in his boat fishing for mackerel when a rival angler cast towards him and left a hook in his cheek .
rod rage : medics had to help remove the two inch hook and police are sure that the act of violence was deliberate .
mr ould has described the moment the two-inch hook suddenly hit his face and believes he is lucky not to be blind .
his boat was several hundreds yards from of a group of recreational anglers and nathan is certain one of them aimed at him intentionally .
the married father-of-two said : ' i could see some weights in the water a little way inside of me but i was n't paying too much attention .
` the next minute there was an almighty bang as a weight hit the boat and as i turned to see what the noise was , whack , i got one in the side of the face .
` the hook was well and truly wedged in my cheek .
it was bleeding badly .
it could have hit me in the eyes .
there was a group of lads standing laughing and joking but they denied it was any of them .
` anglers are always casting towards the boat , in fact they try extra hard to hit you .
it 's to put you off and make you move on .
they just object to you trying to earn a living there .
` it 's not just fisherman who they are doing it at , kayakers are also being targeted .
' incident : mr ould said that anglers object to commercial fisherman
