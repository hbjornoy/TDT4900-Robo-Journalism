a foot-long alligator was found underneath an escalator at chicago 's o'hare international airport on friday .
` we do n't know where it came from or how long it 'd been residing in the airport facilities , ' estrada said .
` it 's one of those random incidents .
' one theory is that the gator was taken to the airport via train and then probably freed after the person realized they were n't going to be able to get past security with it .
photos appeared on twitter of someone with a similar-sized alligator on-board a blue line cta train headed for o'hare , reports cbschicago .
` they probably realized they could n't take it through check point , and just let him go , but oh my god , ' said tineka walker of universal security who first discovered it .
the alligator was spotted underneath this escalator by a maintenance worker .
the animal is now being cared for by the chicago herpetological society .
it will need to be treated for about six months because it .
appears the owner did n't feed it properly and stunted its growth .
` it was in pretty bad shape , ' said jason hood , the group 's president .
` we 're trying to get it healthy and find a place for it .
' he said the gator would likely head to an out-of-state alligator farm once authorities give the organization the all-clear to release the animal .
it 's illegal to keep an alligator as a pet in illinois .
no one was injured .
