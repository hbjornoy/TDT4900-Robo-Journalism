the first contestant to leave the great british bake off has hit back after being trolled on twitter by viewers calling her ` fat ' and a ` cry baby ' .
claire goodwin , 31 , was hounded on social media following her departure from the bbc show , but brushed off the messages , saying : ` sticks and stones will break my bones ... but names will never hurt me .
' the speech and language therapist from cheshire was the first person to leave after she became ` worked up ' over a swiss roll she put together in a bid to impress the judges .
using the hashtag #gbbo , viewers can interact with others during and after the show - but the comments started to become abusive .
one twitter user , going by the name josh bache , said : ` just seen claire use hundreds and thousands ?? off you go you fat melt !! #gbbo .
' simon hooley said : ` you think the fat bird would be great at baking cakes .
' following the abuse , hundreds of fans of the show , which is now into its fifth series , rushed to defend her .
viewer sarah burr said : ` claire you 're amazing ' , while another used described her as a ` legend and inspiration ' to us all .
rhiain geers-davies said : ` shocked at horrid people out there , ' while claire nash added : ` not impressed claire has gone from bake off at all !
' mrs goodwin herself took to the social media site to tell fans she was ` ignoring the gbbo party carnage ' .
she posted : ` sticks and stones will break my bones -lrb- well , maybe not owing to my apparently gargantuan level of blubber : win -rrb- but names will never hurt me .
the contestant admitted she became ` ridiculously worked up ' over the cake and the pressure saw her burst into tears .
mrs goodwin said : ` getting myself ridiculously worked up about the swiss roll was my worst moment .
