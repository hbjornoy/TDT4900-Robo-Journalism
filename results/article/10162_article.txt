` devious conman ' : paul gaffney , 51 , scammed 18 elderly victims - including his own next door neighbour - out of # 105,000 .
a rogue trader who conned elderly residents out of more than # 105,000 has been jailed for nine years .
paul gaffney , 51 , approached vulnerable residents on their doorsteps , offering his services as a home repairman and contractor .
