one goes up , one comes down : a skydiver and instructor swoop down over california as a rocket is launched in the background .
the picture captures the silhouette of a falling instructor and pupil along with the rocket blasting off into space behind them .
staff sgt. thompson was the instructor with the 532nd training squadron based out of vandenberg .
he knew the rocket launch was going to take place on 7th june 2007 and planned his skydive in order to capture the moment from a unique perspective .
the photo is shown on the vandenberg website titled ` one goes up , one comes down ' .
both the launch and the dive were successful .
a closer look : this hi-res image clearly shows the rocket blasting free of the earth 's gravity whilst the skydiver and instructor pass by just a few miles away .
