this is the moment a bungling driver got his 45ft-long lorry stuck between a pub and a cafe after blindly following directions from his sat nav .
the vehicle and its driver were stuck in the narrow bend for half-an-hour until police removed fencing from the pub 's beer garden to make room .
the lorry was on its way to a muller dairy factory when it became stuck in the road in market drayton , shropshire .
the lorry and its driver became stuck between the kings head inn and gill 's pudding cafe in market drayton .
mark king , landlord of the king 's head pub , watched the man try to drive into the narrow street without any knowledge of how tight the space was .
' i was in my garden having a coffee when i saw the lorry trying to turn .
` it was a 45-foot wagon and the driver tried to take the corner and in the end became totally stuck .
` we were shouting at the driver to stop but i do n't think he spoke very good english .
' i had to call the police because he had blocked the road , and he was there for about 30 minutes or so while they worked to unblock him .
' mr king said he had seen lots of trucks and lorries try to trying to make the turn before , but none had ever become lodged in between his pub and the cafe across the road .
it was the first time anyone had become stuck in narrow bend , said pub landlord mark king .
` we do see a lot of trucks trying to turn down here and it is very tight , really too tight for that kind of vehicle .
' ` ideally we could do with stopping lorries turning down here , but i 'm not sure how we can do that .
` on saying that this is the first time i have seen a lorry get wedged here , and well that 's sat navs for you .
' gill smith who owns gill 's pudding cafe said : ` sat nav was certainly no help to this driver looking for mullers .
` the front of the shop here is glass fronted and
