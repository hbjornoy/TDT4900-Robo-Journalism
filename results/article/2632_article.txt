a couple living off food grown in their back garden have become embroiled in a legal battle - because the allotment ` violates planning laws ' .
amanda wadiun , 26 , and her partner paul garnett , 29 , bought the disused plot of land behind their home from bradford council in 2010 .
reminiscent of the lifestyle on tv sitcom the good life , they have eaten produce grown on the land , including potatoes , onions and eggs , for four years .
the good life ?
amanda waidun , paul garnett , and their two sons reuben and alfie live off the food grown in their allotment in wyke , west yorkshire - but bradford council claims it is a violation of planning laws .
garden : they bought the house in 2010 because it was next to a disused plot of land , which they also bought .
however , they have been threatened with ` enforcement action ' and a warning to demolish the wooden chicken run , shed and vegetable patch .
in a letter from the council , bosses said the couple , who have two children , were not allowed to use the land as a ` garden ' - despite selling the plot as ' a private garden ' .
sparking a # 1,000 legal battle , the council added that the family could apply for retrospective planning permission but that the council would recommend refusal .
ms waidun said : ` when we got the letter it was totally out of the blue .
i ca n't tell you how shocked we were .
we had just that morning gone out to by wood to build an aviary .
` we wanted the house because of that plot of land so we .
could live off it .
we are into rearing chickens and we wanted to teach .
our children the value of self-sufficiency .
` every document sent to us when we were purchasing this land said it was to be used as a private garden .
` we now grow everything from cabbage , beans , salad and beetroot .
so much love , money and of course time goes into that land .
livestock : as well as growing potatoes and beetroot , the family keep hens and geese
