alan pardew has confirmed that goalkeeper rob elliot will miss the next ` six to eight games ' and has challenged rookie jak alnwick to win a new contract in that time .
newcastle - who are without first choice tim krul until the end of january - can not bring in a replacement stopper on an emergency loan deal and will instead hand 21-year-old alnwick his full premier league debut at arsenal on saturday .
and pardew , who lost elliot to a torn thigh muscle during last weekend 's 2-1 victory over chelsea , explained : ` robbie will be out for six to eight games , so it 's a great opportunity for jak and he 's very keen to take it .
rookie jak alnwick is set for a sustained run in the newcastle side after an injury to goalkeeper rob elliot .
elliot was forced to leave newcastle 's win against chelsea at the weekend with a thigh injury .
alnwick cut an impressive presence as he thwarted the premier league regularly at st james ' park .
` he 's had a great start and has fitted in very well .
he has worked very hard in the background but never had an opportunity .
` i have great faith in him but he will need a lot of luck as well , particularly in that crucial position .
` he deserves a bit of luck because he is a cracking lad and i 'm very proud of him .
` his contract is up at end of season and this puts him in a great position if he plays really well in the next seven game , and makes it more difficult for us when it comes to contract negotiations .
that is definitely in jak 's court .
