bill o'reilly has remained a controversial voice in the aftermath of a grand jury deciding not to indict darren wilson in the shooting death of michael brown , but on monday the anchor went so far he even manged to alienate a fellow fox news contributor .
remarking on a group of st. louis rams players who adopted a ` hands up , do n't shoot ' stance in a show of solidarity for ferguson protesters prior to sunday 's game , o'reilly said on the o'reilly factor ; ` quite frankly , i do n't think they 're smart enough to know what they 're doing .
' he then added again , ' i absolutely do n't think they 're smart enough to know what they 're doing .

protest : five members of the st. louis rams adopted a ` hands up , do n't shoot ' stance before taking the field on sunday in a show of support for the protesters in ferguson .
speaking out : bill o'reilly said on his show monday that the players were n't ` smart enough to know what they were doing ' and that they were propagating a lie .
he went on to say the men were propagating the lie that brown 's hands were raised at the time he was shot .
not agreeing at all with this statement however was mary katharine ham , a regular fox news contributor , who seemed disgusted with what o'reilly had to say .
ham said she thought that the players ` non-violent ' protest was fine , and then later defended her comments on twitter , saying , ` thing is i do n't care if nfl players make displays w / which i disagree .
not being as upset as you does n't mean i betrayed america .
' fox news analyst juan williams , also a guest on monday , disagreed with o'reilly as well , and his take away that the football players were somehow coming out against all police .
` look , you 've got crazy people on all sides , bill , ' said williams .
` but if you think that those football players identify and say , `` oh , all cops are bad '' ?
that is not true .
' other side :
