in 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02 million people earning more than the # 43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate .
but this year the threshold has fallen to # 41,450 , which means 4.4 million now pay the 40p rate .
in 1988 just 1.35 million was paying that rate .
critics say the higher rate is no longer .
faced only by the ` highly paid few ' but hitting middle earners like .
teachers , nurses and small businesses .
