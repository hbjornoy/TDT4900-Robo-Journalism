the unbearable frustration of andy carroll 's time at west ham is perhaps best summed up by the red card in this fixture last season when , no sooner was he fit than he was suspended , a victim of chico flores ' acting prowess .
that campaign was doomed to never get going , for carroll .
he came back , scored a couple , missed the world cup and was injured again .
there have been times when this season has threatened to go the same way and then there was on sunday when carroll lit the claret-and-blue touch-paper with his first goals of the season , two quite brilliant headers , to propel his team into the top three .
