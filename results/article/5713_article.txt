` dear matthew , joshua , and noah , ' writes weber .
` i wrote a book for you .
i started writing it long before any of you were born , and even before i met your mom , but it was always written for you .
' weber continues , explaining in heartbreaking detail what made him write his deeply personal book : .
` i imagined someday i would have grandkids -lrb- yes , grandkids -rrb- who might be just as interested in me as i was in my grandparents .
and so i started writing a journal , and i kept it brutally honest .
looking back , there 's a lot of stuff i 'm really not proud of , but i figure maybe those ugly things reflect my growth through the years .
this book comes from that journal .
