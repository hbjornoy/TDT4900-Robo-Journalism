relaxed , composed , striking just the right balance between laughs and the serious business of his lifelong ambition , stephen gallacher has taken to the whole ryder cup experience with an ease bordering on aplomb .
long may it continue , right ?
from sit-downs with sir alex to voicemails from martin o'neill , massive crowds for practice days to the enjoyable oddness of individual rivals sharing a team room and a common cause , there is plenty about this week that could overwhelm the average rookie .
as gallacher points out , though , he 's not exactly wet behind those trademark lugs .
ryder cup rookie stephen gallacher says he 's raring to go .
at the age of 39 , he has seen almost everything that golf has to offer .
and , if this can never be described as just another tournament , the fact he comes from a real ryder cup family means he is as ready as any debutant could ever be .
` i am better prepared for this now than i would have been 10 years ago , ' he said .
` i think i am a better golfer and i feel ready for playing now , yeah .
` you know , you try to get in the ryder cup , you know there 's going to be things attached to it , more media and more spotlight .
if you do n't fancy that , well , there 's no point in trying to get in it .
it 's just part and parcel .
` you 're going to get people on the tee and you 're going to get expectations .
the key is to just embrace that and stick to what you 've been doing that got you here .
` it was my lifetime ambition .
it was my goal to get here .
i 'm proud i 'm sitting here .
i am very excited and it is a bit surreal still , because i live so close .
stephen gallacher says playing on home soil will help his ryder cup chances .
` i 'm 39 years old .
i 'm not a rookie to golf .
i 'm maybe a rookie to the ryder cup , but i think having it in my home country is making it a bit easier
