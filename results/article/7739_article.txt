cover-up claims : former mp and lib dem presidency candidate liz lynne at the party 's conference in glasgow last week .
a leading candidate for the lib dem presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up cyril smith 's vile catalogue of child sex abuse .
liz lynne , who succeeded smith as mp for rochdale , allegedly ordered her pa to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile .
they detailed a litany of abuse at the knowl view children 's home in rochdale , which closed in the mid-1990s .
the pa , deborah doyle , said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home , martin digan .
mr digan had contacted miss lynne 's office in rochdale as claims of widespread abuse had begun to emerge at the home , where boys as young as ten had been raped .
he claimed that smith knew of abuse at the school and that it was being covered up by both the home and the local authority .
but miss doyle said her boss did not want to meet mr digan and instructed her to get rid of the notes .
` i was surprised when lynne said to me , `` do n't put the notes in the bin .
destroy them '' , ' said miss doyle .
` i think i took them home and put them on my fire , ' she said .
` it was the only occasion i can remember when liz or i did not act on a piece of constituency work , which is why it stuck in my memory .
' liz lynne , who was mp for rochdale from 1992 to 1997 , is one of four lib dems hoping to take over from tim farron as president of the party .
last night she denied all knowledge of the claims .
she told the guardian she had no recollection of notes detailing child abuse allegations that were written or destroyed by a staff member .
and she said she did not remember being approached by mr digan , who was a former social worker at knowl view .
earlier this year , the politician told the mail how she had heard ` inklings of rumours ' about smith 's involvement
