at two years old , samuel dymott is too young to realise just how incredibly dear he is to his parents .
he knows they love him .
but it will be some time before he comprehends just how much money -- and heartache -- they invested during the four years they spent trying to have him .
his mother jo sharpe had been told by an nhs specialist she would never conceive with her own eggs after blood tests showed she was perimenopausal , meaning she was heading for early menopause .
happy mum : jo sharpe , 38 , and her husband miles dymott , 42 , from brighton , had son samuel , pictured aged six months , after several rounds of ivf and alternative treatments costing # 60,000 .
but after she endured two failed rounds of ivf at a private clinic , and countless alternative therapies , samuel was finally conceived after a third round of ivf .
by then his parents had spent more than # 60,000 ensuring his arrival .
he was born on march 26 , 2012 , weighing 9lb 3oz .
their struggle to become parents has left miss sharpe , a recruitment manager , and her husband miles dymott , an it manager , around # 20,000 in debt .
but samuel is worth every penny to them .
miss sharpe , 38 , said : ` every day i think how lucky i am to have had my own biological child .
it 's such a massive thing for me .
' the couple , from brighton , began trying for a baby soon after marrying .
mr dymott has a daughter , aisha , now 13 , from a previous relationship but they wanted a child together too .
price for joy : samuel , pictured recently , was finally conceived after a third round of ivf , leaving ms sharpe , and mr dymott around # 20,000 in debt .
if the woman is under 35 , doctors usually tell couples they can not have tests until they have tried for 12 months without success to become pregnant .
but after only three months miss sharpe , who was 32 at the time , and her husband went to their gp in 2008 .
` i lied and said we 'd been trying for a year ,
