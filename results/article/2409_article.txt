jon imondi , 33 , stunned newlyweds nathan , 33 , and laura webb , 34 , by singing his best man 's speech .
the amateur singer said he did n't fancy standing up and telling jokes to a room full of people , so did what came naturally to him .
but the singer still managed to drop in the obligatory best man insults , by reworking some of the songs ' lyrics .
his performance included humorous jibes at the groom 's ginger hair and even a suggestion that the bride was marrying her husband out of pity .
the medley began with mr imoldi 's own version of sex is on fire by kings of leon , in which he replaced the lyrics with his ` hair is on fire ' - a dig at nathan 's hair .
he then broke into ` i 'm gon na be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- ' by the proclaimers , before subgubg ` do n't look back in anger ' by oasis and ' a little respect by ' erasure .
the it support engineer finished the medley with a version of elton john 's lion king hit ` can you feel the love tonight ' .
the video shows the wedding guests embracing the performance with many laughing and clapping along as friend gary prosser , 31 , plays the guitar .
the best man , from worcester , said : ` i 'd had about an year to plan this and i was going to do bohemian rhapsody with different words .
` but then it got to a about a week before the wedding and i still had n't prepared anything .
i decided i wanted to play songs with a guitar as well so i asked gary to accompany me
