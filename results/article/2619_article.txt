liese healing , 49 , was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw in july last year .
a cancer patient has had her jaw put back together with a bike chain-like implant after the bone was eaten away by a tumour .
liese healing , 49 , a mother-of-two from rugby , warwickshire , lost half her jaw to the disease after being diagnosed last july .
she was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw after her teeth started to fall out and she suffered from jaw pain .
ms healing , who also beat ovarian cancer in 2005 , had to undergo a 12-hour operation to repair her jaw at university hospital in coventry .
a titanium metal less likely to be rejected by the body was used for the ` chain ' which is attached to her bone using screws .
following the surgery , ms healing spent a month in hospital recovering from the operation and learning to use her new jaw .
she had to learn how to eat and speak again while she underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
she finally finished her cancer treatment on december 28 .
ms healing , who is mother to jonno , 28 , and katie , 20 , said : ` doctors told me i could die in the operation but i had survived one cancer when my children were little and i was n't going to let this one beat me .
` at times it was really difficult to keep positive but i wanted to show my kids their mum was going to be ok .
` i am so grateful to all of the hospital staff who have helped me so much .
' world-leading head and neck surgeons dr gary walton and dr raj sandhu used a titanium chain - which looks like a bike chain -- to hold the reconstructed jaw together after the diseased tissue was removed .
this tissue was replaced with skin grafts from the school science technician 's arm and another graft was also used from her stomach to replace tissue taken from the arm , the coventry telegraph reports .
