a furious mother has demanded police investigate a teacher who she says cut two labels off her daughter 's shoes .
olivia adams , 13 , was told the green and red tags on her kickers shoes broke an ` all-black ' uniform rule at the north school in ashford , kent .
but she was shocked when a staff member apparently knelt down and cut off the tags - while the shoes were on her feet .
olivia adams , pictured , said a teacher cut off the tags to her kickers shoes while she was still wearing them .
despite being offered # 55 by the north school in ashford , kent , her mother has gone to police .
the tags which were cut off shoes belonging to 13-year-old olivia adams .
her mother said : ` i 'm fuming ' a separate pair of shoes - not owned by olivia - which shows how the labels looked before they were cut off .
her mother claire pamment immediately complained to head teacher lesley ellis - who apologised and offered her # 55 to buy a new pair .
but ms pammett took the row to police , insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault .
the row has since escalated when olivia was suspended for a week for naming the teacher on facebook .
mother-of-three ms pammett , a customer services advisor , said : ` i 'm fuming .
` they cut the tabs off my daughter 's shoes while they were still on her feet - i just ca n't believe it .
` they ca n't go around doing things like this .
who does this teacher think she is ?
the north school in ashford , kent , introduced a strict uniform policy in september and sent home 60 pupils .
head teacher lesley ellis declined to comment - though the school initially said olivia gave them permission .
` this is not only criminal damage to my daughter 's shoes , but it is assault because they should n't be touching her .
they really are pushing the rules here .
