a man who had never weighed himself told how an unflattering wedding photograph forced him to shed half his bodyweight .
andrew montgomery , 34 , tipped the scales at 30 stone after a decade of unhealthy living that saw him gorge on a diet of junk food and unhealthy snacks .
he had a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of 60.26 - a healthy bmi is between 18.5 and 25 - putting him in the morbidly obese category , and could not climb a single flight of stairs without panting .
but is was only when he saw pictures of himself dwarfing a slim size 8 bridesmaid at a friend 's wedding that he finally realised he had a serious weight problem .
