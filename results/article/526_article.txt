the terrorist ex-husband of a 19-year-old dutch jihadist rescued from syria by her mother says she lived a happy life among islamic extremists , cooking , going to tea parties and doing ` girl stuff ' .
the girl , who has only been named as aicha , was arrested after her mother brought her back to the netherlands and is suspected of joining a terrorist organisation , meaning she could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted .
her mother , monique verbert , rescued her daughter from syria after reports that she had been treated ` like a slave ' by the jihadists , but aicha 's former husband omar yilmaz painted a very different picture .
terrorist omar yilmaz said the dutch jihadist girl , known only as aicha , lived a happy life doing ` girl stuff ' while living in syria .
aicha was rescued from syria by her mother and brought back to the netherlands , where she has was arrested .
yilmaz , who married aicha after she became infatuated with him , told the sunday times that she lived a pleasant life as a housewife in syria .
he said : ` she would spend most of the day either at home or with our neighbours .
cooking food , tea parties ... girl stuff .
' he said the pair split up amicably after a few months together .
` we both knew it was n't going to work , ' he said .
' i have her her dues ... and went on with my jihad .
' i never harmed her .
when she was married to me ... she had contact with her family daily .
' but aicha is reported to have told turkish media that yilmaz , who is said to have served in the dutch military , used her ` like a slave and threw me away ' .
yilmaz is said to have been a member of the dutch military before going to syria to fight with islamic extremists .
yilmaz , chatting on an instant messaging app , did not mention why he and the 19-year-old split up , but said he thought she had remarried a tunisian fighter since they divorced .
aicha fled to syria in february last year after months of chatting with yilmaz online .
