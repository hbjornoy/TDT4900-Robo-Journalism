a deadly funnel web spider bit eight-year-old brayden martz after his mistook it for a toy and picked it up .
` so , basically i tried to shake it off , but it would n't come off , so i had to flick it off , ' brayden told the central coast gosford express advocate .
brayden 's mother anne martz told the paper she heard brayden screaming before her 15-year-old daughter told her brayden had been bitten .
` ally started a compression bandage and kept brayden calm i rang the ambulance , ' ms martz said .
the family waited about 10 minutes for an ambulance to arrive .
it was not until he reached the hospital that he showed symptoms and his mouth began watering , after which doctors gave him an antivenom .
his mother , who had previously lived in the bush and had read about funnel web spider bites , knew to make a compression bandage for the bite which she did with frozen peas .
` i think it is really important for parents to know what to do , ' ms martz said .
