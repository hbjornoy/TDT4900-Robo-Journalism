mr. king is initially disappointed to learn that although there are many boulevards named after him , they are not in ` nice areas with gardens , ' and then even more upset when he learns that though there is a holiday in his memory , most people just use it as a day to get off of work .
he gets very excited however when he learns there has been a movie made about his life , called selma .
' i guess that will be nominated for a lot of oscars , right ?
' asks king .
when davidson just sighs and looks at him , king responds by saying ; ` oh that mountain is getting really high .
