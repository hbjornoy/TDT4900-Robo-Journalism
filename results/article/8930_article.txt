england coach steve mcnamara was left ` very disappointed ' after winger ryan hall was denied a potentially match-winning last-minute try against australia in the four nations .
the kangaroos were clinging to a 16-12 lead when hall attempted to touch down ahead of full-back greg inglis with 46 seconds left .
neither hall nor his team-mates initially celebrated and with referee gerard sutton not giving a try , his brother bernard , the video official , needed ` sufficient evidence ' -- according to australian nrl rules -- to overturn the decision .
ryan hall had a last-minute try disallowed as australia beat england 16-12 in the four nations on sunday .
hall chased down a grubber kick from liam farrell and felt he chased down the ball ahead of ryan inglis .
but the referee consulted his video assistant to rule out the try , denying the visitors a famous win .
he ruled that hall had failed to find downward pressure , which left australia celebrating a face-saving victory at melbourne 's aami park .

goals : smith -lrb- 2 -rrb- .
england -lrb- 12 -rrb- 12 .
tries : watkins , hall .
goals : widdop -lrb- 2 -rrb- .
mcnamara believes the try should have been awarded and told the bbc : ` i thought it was a try but we probably need to have a lot closer look at that .
it looks like his fingers are on the ball when the ball hit the ground so we are very disappointed .
' hall admitted he was unsure whether he had scored , adding : ` i knew i 'd got something on it but i was n't sure whether i grounded it or not , so i did n't want to make a big fuss about it because we wanted the ball back at least .
` someone said that if it was super league rules , that would have been a try , but we 're not in super league are we ?
' australia coach tim sheens felt the right decision was made .
` had it been a try i think ryan hall would have been celebrating , but he was n't , ' he said .
` they all went back for a line
