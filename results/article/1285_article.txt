millwall left ewood park down , almost out , and in danger of needing snookers to avoid relegation from the championship .
one source of salvation could yet come in the form of a three-point deduction for rotherham when a football league disciplinary commission rules on whether they fielded an ineligible player against brighton on easter monday .
but even that might not be enough .
the result leaves neil harris 's side four points adrift of fourth-bottom rotherham with two tough games remaining against promotion-chasing derby and wolves .
rotherham have a game in hand and a much better goal difference .
rudy gestede -lrb- centre -rrb- scores the opening goal for blackburn as he fires past the helpless david forde .
goals certainly make a difference and , in rudy gestede and jordan rhodes , blackburn have two players that millwall simply do not .
gestede , scorer of a hat-trick against nottingham forest here on saturday , took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute , despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after craig conway 's cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box .
rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory , steering his shot past a stranded david forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser .
the big striker bagged goal number 20 for the season as he continues his excellent form for rovers .
