police investigating a brutal attack on a kitten have been left powerless to take court action against the culprits , because they are as young as four .
the 14-week-old animal was swung by her tail , thrown against a wall and kicked ` like a football ' by the group of three youngsters .
she was rescued by an onlooker , but police could not arrest the children - aged four , five and six , who are believed to be romanian brothers .
attack : the 14-week-old animal was swung by her tail , thrown against a wall and kicked ` like a football ' by the group of three youngsters -lrb- file picture -rrb- .
this was because they are under ten - the age of criminal responsibility .
the kitten , tia , was treated for head injuries , bruised ribs , injured nose and a black eye .
she had been choking on blood running from her nose .
today the kitten 's owner dawn tunnacliffe , 33 , from oldham , greater manchester , said : ` i 'm very angry about what happened .
` i understand the children are from romania .
animals may be treated differently in other countries - but they are not treated like that .
` tia was lucky because she has soft bones like a new baby .
if she had been an older cat she would n't have survived .
' the incident occurred on september 8 at 6.30 pm when miss tunnacliffe was in the back yard chatting to her neighbour lizzie isaacs .
she said : ` tia was playing with some other kittens in the yard when she suddenly went missing .
` lizzie went out to check inside her house but then shouted that some children had got hold of tia in the alley .
` she said they were holding tia by her tail and kicking her like a football .
when she told them to put tia down , they threw her against a wall .
` i ran into the alley to find tia had run off into garden .
she was in a lot of distress .
