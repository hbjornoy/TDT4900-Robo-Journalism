sage advice : mary berry offers some money-saving tips for the festive season .

but families would do better to either buy a smaller one or , preferably , bake their own , says tv cook mary berry .
offering some money-saving tips for the festive season , she said large christmas puddings were an unnecessary expense .
` the best thing is to try to make your own pudding , then you do n't have to spend money , ' she said .
` but if you do buy one , then buy a really small one .

no , it goes in the bin .
' mrs berry said that all too often people fell into the trap of buying too much christmas food .
` it 's important to know how many you 're catering for and not buy too much , ' she told the daily mail .

once all the lists are made , you drop your shoulders and it 's a doddle .
