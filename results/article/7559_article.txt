he said he could see the fox 's ears twitching back and forth trying to pinpoint the location of the vole .
once the fox had pinpointed its prey , it leapt up and dropped down face first into the snow attempting to pin the rodent with its nose or paws .
captured jumping high into the air with eyes fixed on the prize , the bushy tailed fox is seen leaping for his prey and then diving head first into the frozen surface .
with its tail pointed towards the sky , the striking young fox is buried beneath the sheet of white .
