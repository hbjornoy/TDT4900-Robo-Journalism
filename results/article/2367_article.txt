nbc 's bob costas said tuesday that his anti-gun rant , which he delivered during sunday night football programming , was largely misunderstood .
costas told sports radio host dan patrick that 90 seconds was n't enough time for him to ` flesh out ' what he meant to say when he criticized u.s. gun laws as too lenient , and suggested that those laws are to blame for the murder-suicide of the nfl 's jovan belcher .
` what i was trying to say was , that if you want some perspective on this , there are a number of issues related to -lsb- belcher 's murder-suicide -rsb- that we could begin to talk about and think about , ' costas said .
` the problem was that i did n't have enough time to get to many of them .
and that , i think , was my mistake to be quite honest .
