a great-grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for an ambulance after she fell .
beth sheppard , who is 19 stone and suffers from heart problems , was unable to get up after falling in her own home .
her daughter joy , 38 , dialled the ambulance trust 's non-emergency line to ask for a lifting team to assist her 78-year-old mother .
but when the family was told that no one from the community health team was available to attend their home in bristol and they would have to wait for a first responder to be dispatched from 999 .
more than five hours later , no one had arrived .
a great-grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for a south western ambulance -lrb- pictured -rrb- to arrive .
joy said : ' i told the caller i thought this was appalling service and that my mother was now in pain .
` they kept telling me not to feed her or give her a drink , only a sip of water , which was impossible as she was on floor .
' it then took a further two hours before anyone arrived , a full seven after the initial call at around 4.30 pm .
joy said : ` at 11.09 pm i called 999 again and stated how disgusted i was and three minutes later a single paramedic arrived in a car .
' the responder did not have lifting equipment so he had to call for another ambulance to attend as well .
` he radioed for another pair of hands to lift my mum up and two paramedics arrived minutes after in a 4x4 .
they got mum to her feet and she was very wobbly and confused , .
a spokeswoman for south western ambulance service nhs foundation trust has since apologised for the delay and blamed a busy period of calls .
` he said they had been really busy that night .
he was brilliant but i just feel seven hours is far too long to leave someone .
` he informed us five crews had been issued to our job but were then diverted to more serious cases en route .
the paramedics that came were fabulous but the wait was atrocious
