announcement : carla bruni is to finally release her next album of songs after ` years of unhappiness ' as first lady of france , her agent revealed today .
mr de labbey added : ` she suffered from not being able to do her job as a songwriter while she lived at the elysee palace .
` but she made a choice .
she chose a man she loves and she is happy with him .
` she was never a political woman , so she never had the thick skin she needed , and she was always very , very sensitive to all the attacks on her husband .
` in fact she took it all very badly , and after a certain point she became an unhappy woman .
past albums : bruni 's last 2008 album comme si de rien n'itait , left , sold only 90,000 copies last year , and her music is virtually unknown outside france .
right her album - no promises .
` but she has now written a beautiful .
new album , and i hope the critics will be able to look beyond her past .
as first lady and see it 's true artistic qualities .
' bruni , 45 , hinted recently that she had no wish for sarkozy to bid for a second term as president .
she said : ' i do n't really want to talk about that .
the press was deplorable with my husband and very agressive with him .
` the level of criticism and lies reached incredible levels .
but i suppose that 's the freedom of the press for you .
