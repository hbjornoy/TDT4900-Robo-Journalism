big brother , towie , the farm ... just when you think you 've seen them all , a new reality show turns up as the new kid on the block .
this week , it was the turn of the real housewives of cheshire - a reality show that stars six wags from a county famous for footballers and excess .
each of the women had enough sparkle , slap and sass to outshine even the brassiest drag queen from london 's soho , but there was one housewife who appeared head and shoulders above the rest - ampika pickston .
scroll down for video .
ampika pickston , 32 , from hale came into money after marrying a rich older man but admits she 'd never date an unwealthy man .
the real housewives of cheshire star also claims that brits have a stigma of hatred to people who lead luxurious lives .
ampika , 32 , got married to mark pickston , 54 , a multi-millionaire businessman in her twenties and the couple lived an an enormous mansion in hale , cheshire , together .
but the couple have since divorced and the former glamour model has now set up her own beauty salon in order to keep the cash rolling in .
despite not actually having the only credential needed to be on the real housewives of cheshire - being a wife - it is clear why itvbe producers picked her as part of the six-woman cast ; she speaks her mind and more .
in the first episode of the reality show , ampika tells cameras : ` i 'm not a little rag doll - i 'll play with the toys , and when i 'm done with you , i 'll discard you .
' and when i meet her this week at the itv studios in london , she is exactly the same .
even though it is midday on a rainy weekday afternoon , ampika is dressed to the nines in vertiginous heels and a tight strapless dress , and wearing more make-up and hairspray than i use in a month .
