staff at st giles ' junior school in bedworth , warwickshire , told maddie stevens she could n't go on the trip to frankie & benny 's on tuesday because she did not have 100 per cent attendance .
the schoolgirl 's mother gail stevens died of breast cancer in january this year following a two year battle with the disease .
maddie stevens , 11 , who was not allowed to go on the ' 100 per cent attendance ' trip , with her father andy .
her father andy stevens , 48 , a finance manager , did not find out about the her exclusion until tuesday evening , which was after the trip had taken place and too late for him to appeal .
he said : ` it 's just so insensitive after everything she has been through .
` maddie has been absolutely amazing since her mum died .
` she took only one day off to go the funeral , because we wanted to keep things as normal for her as we could .
but even if she 'd taken a week off i 'd be saying this .
maddie 's mother gail had battled breast cancer for two years before she passed away in january this year .
maddie did not tell her father andy -lrb- pictured on trip to london -rrb- about the trip until after it had happened .
he added : ` she got very upset when gail passed away and at the funeral , but she 's just tried to get on with things .
and after all that , she gets this kick in the face .
` her school should be celebrating what she 's achieved not saying `` you ca n't come on the school outing because your mum died '' .
` it 's not even about frankie & benny 's - my wife and i have said we 'll take her anytime - it 's the principle .
' maddie said : ` it made me feel sad not to be able to go because a few of my friends went .
` it would have been a nice treat .
