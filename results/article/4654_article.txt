on the mend : jamie moore is recovering in manchester after his ordeal in spain .
former champ : moore was forced to retire from boxing in 2010 .
but moore says he feared the worst when he collapsed in a pool of blood on august 3 .
he recalls : ' i thought : `` i 'm not going to make this '' .
i thought i was finished and it 's the emptiest , most horrible feeling ever .
i felt helpless and lonely -- lying on a driveway at night bleeding to death .
i thought : `` i ca n't die here ... how am i going to leave my kids with no dad ?
'' ` considering the circumstances , ' moore told the guardian , ' i was really calm .
it all relates back to boxing and staying calm under pressure .
it instils discipline and composure .
i could have easily panicked and stood up and i would have bled even more then .
pupil : birmingham middleweight matthew macklin -lrb- right -rrb- was being trained by moore .
' a woman came on and i said : ` i 've been shot .
i 'm at a house in estepona but i do n't know the address .
'' ` she needed the address but i said : `` if you do n't trace my phone i 'll die .
i 'm bleeding really badly .
'' so she got on to the police and they traced my phone .
she was telling me to stem the blood and try and stay conscious .
i was trying , but i was in and out .
` it was 25 minutes before the ambulance got there -- and i remember saying to the woman in the back : ` please do n't let me die ... '
