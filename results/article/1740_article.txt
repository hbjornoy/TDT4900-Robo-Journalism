customers could end up paying more for phone contracts over the next year or so as a direct result of ofcom increasing the amount it charges operators to rent radio spectrum .
plans unveiled by the telecoms industry regulator reveal it intends to increase rental fees by more than 400 per cent in some cases , to bring the prices in line with the market value in other countries .
mobile operators have slammed the plans as ` disappointing ' and ` excessive ' and such increases could see operators raising the price for phones , calls , data and monthly contracts to claw back some of this extra money .
ofcom 's price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses .
vodafone and o2 will each pay # 83.1 m a year - a 433 % rise , while ee and three 's are set to increase by 330 % to # 107.1 m and # 35.7 m respectively .
these rises could be filtered to customers , but no official announcement has been made .
