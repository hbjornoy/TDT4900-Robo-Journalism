former manchester united striker diego forlan believes radamel falcao has been put under too much pressure to perform since returning from his knee injury .
falcao sustained ligament damage in january last year and did n't return to fitness until after the world cup .
the colombian ace then joined united on loan from monaco but has failed to live up to his billing .
forlan believes the pressure put on the 28-year-old has played a significant part in his current dip in form .
diego forlan believes radamel falcao has been put under too much pressure since returning from injury .
falcao again struggled as manchester united drew 0-0 with cambridge united in the fa cup .
` there was pressure on him to make it back for the world cup last summer with colombia , ' forlan said in his column in the nation .
` maybe too much , it was unrealistic .
' ` falcao had played very little football when he signed for manchester united , the world 's greatest football club .
` because falcao had built this huge reputation and because he was earning a lot of money , great things were expected , but it was never going to be straightforward .
` nobody comes back from a serious injury and is the same after a month or even three months .
psychologically , you need to build your confidence back up and you hope there are no complications .
even in a settled side it 's hard .
' the colombian forward has scored just three times since moving to manchester united .
forlan understands the pressure of playing for united - the uruguayan also struggled while in england .
