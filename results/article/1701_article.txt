cardiff city have asked to take manchester united midfielder michael keane on loan but louis van gaal will wait to see if the club make progress on new defensive recruitments before allowing him out .
van gaal is keen to strengthen his back-line at old trafford before approving the move , particularly after united missed out on signing thomas vermaelen from arsenal .
the gunners wanted chris smalling to go in the other direction for vermaelen 's switch to go through , something van gaal blocked from happening .
the belgium international has since joined catalan giants barcelona .
international pedigree : michael keane , centre , has played for england at u19 and u21 level in recent years .
blackburn are also interest in a temporary deal for keane , who spent the second half of last season on loan at ewood park .
he scored three times in 13 appearances during his time at the club , as they finished just outside the championship play-off places in eighth .
keane , who has played for england at u21 level , also enjoyed a successful loan spell at leicester during the 2012-13 campaign .
