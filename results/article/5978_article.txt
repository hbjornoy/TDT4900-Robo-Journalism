jackpot !
a mystery benefactor is hiding envelopes filled with # 50 each across britain in a mass treasure hunt .
winner : twitter user @leviaxxan , who found the money with a friend in sheffield , shared the haul between the donkey sanctuary in devon and the sheffield rape crisis counselling service for women .
the mystery benefactor told the daily telegraph he may make a special delivery tomorrow to london - but with the package containing up to # 200 , the hunt could turn into a frenzied scramble .
' i have had a few businesses in e-commerce that have done really well for me , ' he said .
` it got to a point where there is only so much stuff that money can buy ... i get more of a kick out of that than i would spending # 50 on myself .
' i have to travel abroad but i 've called on a group of people to keep it going for me .
it will be a little more infrequent but i do n't have any plans to stop .
` there is n't a limit on how much i 'm going to give away .
as long as there 's interest in it , i 'll keep doing it .
' he added that he was confident george groves would win tonight 's boxing match against carl froch , but would hide # 200 in the capital if he lost .
and he told mailonline he hopes his project will become a long-running fixture .
