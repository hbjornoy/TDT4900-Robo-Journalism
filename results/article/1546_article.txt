the millennial generation is often believed to be more chilled out than baby boomers - especially when it comes to travel .
but a new infographic by chase card services suggests otherwise - indicating that luxury and its perks are more important to younger holidaymakers than older ones .
a survey of 1,000 people aged 18-67 reveals that millennials are more likely than older travellers to seek out hotels with luxury services such as dry cleaning -lrb- 32 per cent -rrb- , massage or spa services -lrb- 30 per cent -rrb- and pet-friendliness -lrb- 23 per cent -rrb- .
furthermore , the survey shows millennial travelers are more likely to say it 's a ` deal breaker ' if a hotel is not near public transportation -lrb- 19 per cent -rrb- .
sisy vicente , general manager , chase card services , said : ` millennials are a tech savvy generation that values social connections , convenience and opportunities to indulge in luxuries .
' ` this is a generation of travellers that clearly sees the benefit of travel rewards , such as those that come with elite status in reward programmes .
