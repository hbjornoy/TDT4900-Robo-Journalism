matthew dillon , who found love and fathered two children during more than four years on the run .
an escaped prisoner fathered two children with a woman who did n't know he was a wanted man before police caught up with him .
matthew dillon , 34 , fled from sudbury open prison in 2009 , after he became ` fed-up ' with his daily routine .
after staging the simple escape , dillon found love and was living with his unwitting partner - who had no idea he was on the run - and their two children when police finally tracked him down .
dillon left the open prison , near uttoxeter , staffordshire , in august 2009 as he neared the end of a 10 year eight month jail term for robbery .
but police did not track him down until september , even though he was living in perton , west midlands , just 40 miles away .
he was returned to jail on friday after admitting one charge of escape from lawful custody at stafford crown court .
imprisoning him for the rest of his sentence , plus a further six months , recorder adam feest said : ` it 's a great shame you chose to walk out , you would have been released fairly soon afterwards .
` you have since shown you can live a law-abiding life .
' david bennett , prosecuting , said police officers who arrested him asked dillon why he had absconded from sudbury and his reply was that he was ` fed up ' with the prison 's regime .
mr bennett said : ` he said he wanted to hand himself in , but he had met a partner , they 'd had children together and he did not want to return to prison .
his partner had no idea he had absconded from prison .
' hm prison sudbury : matthew dillon 's partner had no idea that he had escaped from the derbyshire jail .
the court heard that dillon was sentenced in september 2004 for conspiracy to rob and was due for release after serving two-thirds of the jail term .
