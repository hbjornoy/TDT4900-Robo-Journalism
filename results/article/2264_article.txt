but when she called durham constabulary she was told officers were unable to attend until later and asked her to preserve the crime scene by herself .
rev murray said : ' i noticed the footprints in the snow so i followed them and found the lead had been stolen and the metal gates - they are about 4ft high and very heavy .
evidence : the vicar had to point out to police officers that she could n't preserve the footprints as the snow was already melting .
` the footprints i found were from an adult with big feet .
' i rang police to report it and they asked if i would be to cover the set of footprints and preserve them until the police came out to see me later .
' i said it would not be possible because the snow was melting and also i had a funeral later that day and they might be trampled on .
` the only appointments available were 2pm or 4pm but the earlier one was not convenient , so they were not able to use the footprints .
' i found the phone call quite humorous .
