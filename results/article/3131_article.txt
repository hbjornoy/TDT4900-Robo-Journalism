manchester united manager louis van gaal will contest the disrepute charge for criticising referee chris foy after his team 's fa cup draw at cambridge two weeks ago .
van gaal said it was ` always the same ' with referees when bigger teams play against smaller clubs , leading the fa to charge him with implying bias on foy 's part .
now it has emerged the united manager will request a personal hearing with the governing body at which he will explain he was just trying to make a general point .
louis van gaal hopes he wo n't have have the book thrown at him for comments made about referee chris foy .
united take on west ham away on sunday and van gaal said : ` i am not angry , i am very disappointed .
i am now for nearly 30 years a trainer-coach or manager and i have never been charged .
and still , up to now , i do n't think that i said something wrong .
` i said already in our press conference -lrb- before the game -rrb- the same phrases , because i know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog .
` i said it before the game and i said it after the game , only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody , everybody for the underdog .
` so i can not imagine the fa has charged me .
but , ok , it 's like that .
of course i will contest it .
i never said anything wrong .
you can confirm , as the media , that i never say anything about the referee , in all the matches .
' van gaal 's men were held to a 0-0 draw against league two team cambridge united back in january .
however the red devils did not let lightning strike twice and were 3-0 winners in the replay at old trafford .
van gaal refused to buy in to former united manager sir alex ferguson 's theory that the fa used to pick on the club simply because of its standing in the game .
but it is clear he is irritated .
united are , at least , in the next round of the fa cup , having beaten cambridge 3-0 in the replay at old trafford
