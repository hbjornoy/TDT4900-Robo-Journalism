pamela young has condemned ` soft touch ' justice after judges upheld a four-year sentence for lewis gill , 21 , who killed her son with a single punch .
the mother of an asperger 's sufferer killed with one punch condemned the ` soft touch ' justice system that has upheld his attacker 's short sentence .
andrew young , 40 , died after lewis gill smashed him in the face in an unprovoked attack .
yesterday the court of appeal ruled gill 's four-year term was not unduly lenient even though the 21-year-old is likely to serve just half of that .
the decision sparked public anger and mr young 's mother pamela said it showed criminals were not being held to account .
the 71-year-old added : ` in this country people can get away with anything , not through the police , but through the courts .
` my sympathies are with the police who do a brilliant job .
the police have done their duty but the judicial system has n't .
the judicial system is a soft touch .
` i did n't think it was justice for andrew at the time but it 's now gone to the highest court in the land .
if the highest court says that 's ok then i respect that .
` it 's best not to have any revenge .
if you have revenge in your mind the only person you will hurt is yourself .
' asked if justice would had been served with a longer term , she said : ` i suppose it would .
it wo n't bring andrew back .
' her son , who had a mental age of 14 , was attacked in a bournemouth street last november 6 when he challenged gill 's friend for riding his bicycle on the pavement .
gill , a convicted robber and trained boxer , turned back and punched mr young square in the face .
he fell backwards , fracturing his skull , and died the next day in southampton hospital with his mother at his side .
the horrifying incident was caught on cctv .
