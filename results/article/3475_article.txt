dear lord hall , .
my jeans are too tight , my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , my friends are all incredibly right-wing and i 've got hog-whimperingly drunk in the presence of david cameron on more than one occasion .
but none of these are the reasons why i want you to give me jeremy clarkson 's job .
i know many men may baulk at the suggestion that a woman can take jeremy 's place .
just look at what happened to sue perkins this week , who received a barrage of abuse on twitter when her name was mentioned for the role , along the lines of : ` men do cars , women do cake .
' but i think i 'm perfect for the job , and my principal qualification is entirely basic .
i love cars .
scroll down for video .
sarah vine says the bbc need to look further than just men when it comes to finding a tv presenter to replace jeremy clarkson on top gear .
why ?
because women love cars just as much men !
i like the big ones with leather seats and walnut dashboards .
i like the mad ones with three types of suspension .
i like the small , nippy ones with exciting turning circles .
i like the old-fashioned ones with manual chokes .
i even like those weird french ones with the hydraulic suspension that feel and handle like ocean-liners .
all the most memorable moments in my life feature the internal combustion engine .
as a baby , the only way my parents could get me to go to sleep was to drive me round the block in their mini cooper .
several times .
once i 'd nodded off , they 'd reward themselves with a pint and a packet of crisps , leaving me happily slumbering in the pub car park .
those were more laissez-faire times .
when i was four , we emigrated to italy and the mini was sold .
i clung on to the bumper for dear life , as though they had come to take away my favourite teddy .
in the end it was all right , though , because it was soon replaced by a far more exciting prospect : an orange alfasud -- an alfa romeo
