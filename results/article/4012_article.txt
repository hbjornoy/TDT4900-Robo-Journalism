sitting on the bench is never something any footballer relishes .
but it is not normally as embarrassing as it was for the derry city players who took a perch for the official team photo ahead of the fai cup final .
captain barry molloy , manager peter hutton and northern ireland striker rory patterson were among the eight team members left red faced when the bench they were sat on collapsed as they smiled for the camera at their stadium , brandywell .
the bench collapsed as the squad were posing ahead of their fai cup final clash with st patrick 's athletic on november 2 .
the rest of the squad were in hysterics as the players who dropped to the floor were helped up .
the squad will hope it is not a bad luck omen ahead of the final against st patrick 's athletic on november 2 .
it left the rest of the squad in hysterics , but they all eventually gained their composure to have the photograph taken properly and perhaps most importantly , no players were injured from the incident .
derry are sixth in the league of ireland table with two games left to play while they are preparing for their final against st patrick 's athletic on november 2 .
hutton 's side overcame shamrock rovers in the semi-final , while st patrick 's beat finn harps .
the players regained composure and the official photograph was eventually taken , with smiles all round .
it will be the tenth time derry have reached the final of the competition , having won it five times already .
and manager hutton will no doubt be hoping his players will be wiping the floor in a different way when they take to the pitch at the aviva stadium .
