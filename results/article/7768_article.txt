dozens of elderly chinese people have been killing themselves to avoid a looming ban on burials .
the elderly suicides want to make sure their deaths are registered before a june 1 deadline , after which anhui province authorities will close all cemeteries .
anyone who dies after that date will have to be cremated because , authorities say , cemeteries are taking up too much space .
a father pushes his baby down a road past a pile of coffins smashed by officials to drive home the looming ban on burials brought in because cemeteries are taking up too much space in anhui province , china .
in order to drive the message home council officials have been visiting funeral parlours and smashing up coffins .
the draconian move has only hastened the rate of suicide as elderly people rush to guarantee one of the few remaining .
the new rules were published on april 1 .
regional officials said : ` before june 1 people can still consign their bodies for burial , but after that the only option offered will be cremation .
' in urban areas it has meant little change , but in rural areas the idea of cremation is abhorrent to many and there has been extreme opposition .
local media has reported dozens of cases in which elderly people have killed themselves in order to qualify for a burial .
zhang wenying , 81 , hanged herself on may 13 .
she left behind a note saying she had ended it all to make sure she could have a decent death , and she expected to be buried .
another was 97-year-old wu lixiu , who died on may 12 .
there have also been deaths in the provincial capital , and in three villages elders recorded at least seven people who have committed suicide to make sure they are buried instead of cremated .
` it 's hard for the old people to accept the policy , so the government should give them more time to think about it , but not carry out the policy on such short notice , ' said one elder .
