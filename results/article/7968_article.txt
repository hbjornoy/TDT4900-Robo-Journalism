as many as half a million men are thought to have ditched the razor this month to grow a moustache in aid of the movember appeal .
now moustache mania has taken to the skies after airlines painted them beneath the noses of their jets to help raise awareness of prostate and testicular cancer .
british airways , virgin , qantas and westjet planes are all sporting the quirky additions - ranging from trim ` connoisseur ' styles to a full-blown handlebar moustache and beard .

last year male employees of british airways raised # 80,000 for the prostate cancer charity by sprouting moustaches for movember .
this time around the airline has gone one step further by adding freshly-painted facial fuzz to its fleet of aircraft .
head of health services liz wilkinson said : ` we 're always delighted to support movember , it 's a charity that 's very dear to our hearts here at british airways , especially as our former ceo lord marshall suffered from the disease .
' the firm considered various styles for its planes - including the pencil , the handlebar , the horseshoe and the trucker - before finally settling on the neat connoisseur moustache .
