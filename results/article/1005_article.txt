yang xiao -lrb- pictured before his operation -rrb- , 27 , from china , had a huge tumour on his back and neck .
it weighed a stone and a half -lrb- 10kg -rrb- .
mr yang developed a small tumour on his neck about ten years ago .
it grew rapidly and was soon as big as an egg .
in 2007 , he went to hospital in xi'an and the tumour was diagnosed as fibromatosis -- a benign soft tissue tumour .
mr yang and his father , yang jigao , considered surgery and were warned it was difficult and risky .
as a result , his father , who had already lost his wife and daughter , decided not to take the risk .
after leaving the hospital , mr yang 's tumour continued to grow .
mr yang first developed a small tumour on his neck when he was a teenager but it grew rapidly .
mr yang considered having surgery in 2007 but his father did not want him to as he was warned it was risky and he had already lost his wife and daughter so could n't face losing his son as well .
it was soon as large as half a football and more tumours had appeared on his back and collarbone .
at the end of 2013 the father and son returned to hospital -- this time they went to xijing hospital , in xi'an .
by this point the tumour on mr yang 's back measured 45cm from top to bottom and 30cm across .
it was also 17cm thick and weighed a stone and a half .
surgeons informed mr yang that surgery would be risky but that he would have a good chance of recovery .
mr yang 's tumour was still growing
