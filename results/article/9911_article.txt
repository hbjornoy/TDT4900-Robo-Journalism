everyone who uses a smartphone , laptop or tablet computer could face censorship by brussels under the eu 's new right to be forgotten rule , a house of lords report warned yesterday .
the law -- which allows anyone to request for material about them to be taken off the internet -- could apply not just to internet giants such as google but to every individual who uses the internet or social media .
it could leave individuals open to legal challenges from people who want them to remove material from their facebook page , twitter account , or even from their own email or text records , according to the house of lords european union committee .
facebook : users of the social network could face censorship under the eu 's ` right to be forgotten rule ' it said the right to be forgotten rule was wrong in principle and unworkable in practice .
eu judges ruled that people should have the right to demand that links to material about them are removed from search engines if the information is ` inadequate , irrelevant or excessive ' .
peers said the rule ` logically ' extended to users and urged ministers to ` ensure that the definition of data controller in the new regulation is amended to clarify that the term does not include ordinary users of search engines ' .
