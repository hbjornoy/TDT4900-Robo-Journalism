the first-half performance against slovenia on saturday does not mean england should ditch their diamond formation -- they just need to use it better .
roy hodgson 's side struggled in the opening 45 minutes , which led some to suggest that the solution is a return to using wingers .
but i think to get a diamond system to prosper , you need to get your best players on the ball in between the lines , in the most dangerous parts of the pitch .
raheem sterling struggled to get into the game during the first half of england 's 3-1 win against slovenia .
sterling 's touch map proves he was unable to get on the ball in key areas against slovenia .
that 's where england failed .
look at the touch map of raheem sterling 's night : he barely touched the ball in the danger zone just outside the slovenian penalty area .
england need to get him on the ball more .
this system is all about having an extra man in the middle of the park and england need to use whoever is best for that .
they also need to play with a lot more purpose and pace from the off .
they only did that once they had conceded .
i ca n't remember many england debuts as good as nathaniel clyne 's .
he deserves to keep the shirt .
kieran gibbs did well but needs to go forward with the same conviction .
southampton right back nathaniel clyne impressed on his senior england debut against slovenia .
video we 're happy for welbeck - hodgson .
