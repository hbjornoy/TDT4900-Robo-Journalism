a homeless man who received a surprise meal and hotel stay after spending a $ 100 donation on food for his friends has insisted that no part of the experience was a hoax - despite the fact one witness is claiming the whole thing was a set-up .
the man - named only as thomas - had been filmed living on the streets of california , before being taken to a sushi restaurant , given a hotel room with hot tub and treated to a new suit and haircut .
but the resulting video posted online by ` serial prankster ' josh paler lin was met with varying degrees of skepticism , with a number of viewers dismissing it as a hoax .
one witness , in particular , has insisted that there was no way that thomas did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as paler lin .
