the adorable story of how tiny the dog was rescued by the new zealand navy after being stuck on a floating log has been set straight by his owner .
ben ngawaka , 20 , said his pal had , in fact , only been stranded for a few hours on smokehouse bay , and not for two days since a storm had hit the area , as previously reported .
mr ngawaka said he took his boat out from his home on rangiahua island home to do some shopping at the nearest store at port fitzroy on great barrier island with his dog on thursday .
the crew of the new zealand navy ship hawea spotted the dog standing helplessly on a drifting log .
he stopped to collect a floating log he thought might be useful for building repairs , mr ngawaka told the new zealand herald on sunday .
` i had a little look for -lrb- tiny -rrb- when i got to fitzroy and could n't find him .
i realised , `` oh , my dog must have got off on that log '' , ' he said .
` he must have thought that when we stopped , we were parking on the shore and jumped off .
' mr ngawaka said he was n't concerned because he knew tiny would stay put .
