four of the best 10 universities in the world are in the uk , according to a new international table .
and a record six british institutions have made it into the top 20 in the latest annual qs world university rankings .
but experts warned that the uk 's leading position could be under threat without more funding .
the top-ranked uk university is cambridge , which has slipped down a place to third this year , behind massachusetts institute of technology - which also topped the rankings last year - and harvard , both leading us universities .
highly rated : cambridge university was the highest ranked uk institution coming third in the qs world university rankings .
highly regarded : university college london came just behind cambridge in the rankings , rated as the fourth best institution in the world .
also in the top 10 were university college london -lrb- ucl -rrb- in fourth place , imperial college london in fifth , and oxford in sixth .
the other institutions in the top 10 were all in the united states .
edinburgh and king 's college london both moved up into the top 20 in 17th and 19th place respectively .
there were eight uk universities in total in the top 50 and 18 in the top 100 .
qs head of research ben sowter said the prestige of a uk degree is recognised by employers around the world .
the authors said that of the 45 british institutions in top 400 , 29 rank lower than they did at the time of the economic crisis in 2008/09 .
since the recession , 21 institutions in the uk have dropped by more than 10 places in the rankings , while five are now 10 places higher than in 2007 .
climber : imperial college london in kensington was up one place in the ratings from sixth to fifth .
cambridge was the only uk university to make the global top 30 for research , with ucl , oxford and imperial making it into the top 50 .
this suggests that the uk is struggling to keep up with the us in producing cutting-edge research , the authors said
