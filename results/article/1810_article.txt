jeremy clarkson -lrb- right -rrb- was due to front the top gear live tour from next month , but talks are now underway about how the shows can go ahead and if bbc branding will be removed after he was dismissed .
it is understood if the corporation tries to block the world tour , which starts in australia next month , from going ahead they could be liable for refunding tickets at a total cost of around # 10million .
fans have paid between # 35 and # 200 for tickets to the live shows .
one option could be to allow the events , which will also take place in london and south africa , to go ahead under a different name and without some of the key elements of the lucrative bbc show - such as the stig .
a message on the top gear live tour website thanks fans for their ` continued patience ' .
it says : ` we have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of jeremy 's contract not being renewed by the bbc .
