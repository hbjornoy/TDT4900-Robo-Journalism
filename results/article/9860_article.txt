at first glance , this slide looks like a fun playground toy for children .
but anyone who tried it out would get a nasty shock - when they plummeted 40ft down the side of the building .
the slide has horrified locals in eastern china who are concerned that kids might reach the roof where it is located .
watch out below : this slide is located on top of a three-storey building and leads straight off the side .
the frame is placed on top of a three-storey factory in heze , shandong province , where the slides are manufactured .
it is located so that the end of the slide leads straight off the building , so that any foolish thrill-seeker would drop directly onto a concrete car park .
neighbours have voiced fears that the colourful object could prove irrestible to teenagers .
` we worry that our children might get in there at weekends and try to play on it , ' one said .
` you 'd have to be mad to put a slide there .
' tempting ?
locals are concerned that children could climb up to the roof and use the slide .
factory managers say the slide is meant to advertise the company 's wares , and is not intended to be used by anyone .
however , following the local outcry , they have agreed to take the object away .
` we can understand people 's fears so we will be removing the slide , ' a spokesman said .
this is not the first time that chinese authorities have been blasted for showing an apparently lax regard for public safety .
earlier this month , a five-year-old boy was left bruised and bloodied when he was propelled into the air by excessively powerful water jets at a public fountain in hubei province .
sometimes it is members of the public themselves who court danger - in february , two tourists at a national park were pictured riding on top of a cable car .
