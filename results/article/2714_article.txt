author barbara taylor bradford has decided to help two distant relatives by selling her # 1.5 million collection of jewellery .
the 80-year-old author of a woman of substance , who has no children , is to auction off her diamond rings , ornate brooches , dazzling necklaces and timeless bracelets - most of which were presents from her husband bob .
she initially thought of giving the 40-strong collection to the two women , who are described as ` wider family members ' .
jewellery belonging to author barbara taylor bradford goes on display at bonhams showroom , this sapphire ring is expected to fetch # 98,000 when its sold by the auctioneers later this week .
a 19th century sapphire and diamond brooch from the collection is displayed and estimated at # 65,000 - # 75,000 .
but she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would want or wear ` as they do n't lead the same lifestyle as me ' .
a 14-carat diamond ring which will go under the hammer in the bonham 's december 5 sale , has been valued at almost # 500,000 and a pair of harry winston diamond and pearl earrings is expected to fetch up to # 75,000 in the sale .
speaking about the collection , she said : ` my .
father told me when i was a child , after he gave me a string of pearls : .
`` you must always let them breathe .
they should be out on your neck , not .
buried in a drawer .
'' ` why was all this buried in a drawer ?
well , i did n't know .
` then i .
realised i was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female .
heirs .
they did n't really want it , i do n't think , because they do n't .
really lead the kind of life that i lead as a well-known writer , and i 'm .
out and about .
` so bob .
and i decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be a .
little nest egg for them .
let somebody else enjoy those
