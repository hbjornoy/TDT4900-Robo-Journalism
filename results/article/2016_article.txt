she said : ` philip was outside his property .
he appeared to be drunk .
he was slurring and staggering .
the dog came out from a field .
it was n't on a lead .
the dog ran in front of us and i put my hand down and it licked the tip of my finger then all of a sudden it attacked my daughter 's face .
' i thought it was going to jump up and lick her face but it was when i heard the growl i realised it was attacking her .
` it jumped on her chest and she stepped back because it knocked her .
she was standing up for a while -- it felt like forever -- then after a few seconds it had her on the floor .
it was on her face and i knew it was attacking her .
