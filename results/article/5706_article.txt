chelsea are weighing up a # 12million move for dinamo kiev winger andriy yarmolenko .
although russian born , the 24-year-old is one of the stars of ukraine 's national side along with liverpool target yevhen konoplyanka of dnipro .
yarmolenko is 6ft 2ins , quick , powerful and has a decent goals record with 54 in 146 games for kiev and 15 in 39 for the national side .
target : andriy yarmolenko -lrb- left -rrb- could be winging his way to the premier league .
on the attack : yarmolenko -lrb- right -rrb- takes on england 's ashley cole in a world cup qualifier in kiev .
kiev wanted # 20m for the left-footed yarmolenko last summer but are willing to sell for less now .
he has been reluctant to leave kiev and but a move to london appeals and roman abramovich 's connections could smooth the way .
liverpool have shown an interest in the past as have arsenal but had concerns about the player 's consistency .
liverpool , meanwhile have spoken to bayern munich about the cost of xherdan shaqiri as southampton continue to demand # 25m for adam lallana .
