scottish premier league club motherwell have launched the new initiative ` flexi-ticket ' , in an attempt to allow fans to get to more games , but for cheaper prices .
the revolutionary idea allows fans to buy either a five or 10 match ticket , appealing to fans who can not commit to a full season ticket .
after receiving feedback , the club determined that fans were unable to attend games due to work commitments and various other issues .
passionate : motherwell are hoping to bring in more fans with the new flexi-ticker initiative .
affordable : motherwell are making ticket prices very reasonable to their supporters .
at # 150 for 10 games , which works out to just # 15 per game , the flexi-ticket ensures fans who ca n't make every game get the same cost-per-game value as full-time season ticket holders .
motherwell have launched initiatives like this before , such as ` bring a friend along for free ' schemes to league games , boosting both attendances and relationships with fans .
meanwhile , the steelmen currently sit 10th in the scottish premiership after picking up three points from their opening five games .
