lee catton , 48 , was allegedly driving at 42mph along a 30mph stretch of road when he hit hichame bouadimi , dragging the boy under the wheels of his truck .
hichame , who had been walking with his mother and older sister , had run into st georges road near the elephant and castle roundabout , in south london , after slipping from the clutches of his mother 's hand .
jacob hallam , prosecuting , told jurors : ` this is a tragic case ; it involves the sudden death of a little boy , hichame bouadimi .
` he was only five-years-old when he was killed on the afternoon of october 3 , 2012 .
` he -lsb- hichame -rsb- somehow slipped from his mum 's hand and ran on to the road .
why he did that we will never know but he did .
' mr hallam added : ` hichame 's death must have been virtually instantaneous , his injuries were terrible .
` his body lay in the road after mr catton 's lorry had driven over it , people who were there went towards him , one of them covered him with their coat .
' woolwich crown court heard how a speed recording device in catton 's lorry had later showed that he had been driving above the speed limit at the time of the impact .
mr hallam said : ` he was driving too fast on a school day when uniformed school children were around on both sides -lsb- of the road -rsb- ' catton told police afterwards that he had suddenly become aware of a figure running into the path of his lorry from the left adding : ` by the time i saw him it was too late ' .
scene of the death : hichame was walking with his mother and older sister before he apparently ran into st george 's road in the elephant and castle area of south london .
