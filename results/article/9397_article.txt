it has been a long 20 minutes but , finally , phil jagielka is smiling .
everton 's captain has been dealing with thorny issues that have blighted his side 's campaign when the topic of squad discontent arises .
such is the way of life on merseyside that when one of the city 's teams fares badly , stories of in-fighting , a kerfuffle on the training ground or a manager and player at loggerheads spread like wild fire .

i do n't know where half of the stuff comes from but that is the way it goes .
the only good thing about those stories is that it gives us a little bit of a laugh at the training ground .
` we appreciate the people that make up the really funny stuff it keeps us going on a day to day basis people are always going to talk , pundits can have their own opinions and papers are going to be written but there is not much we can do to stop that .

everton were a breath of fresh air last year but this campaign has been one of inconsistency and disappointment .
jagielka has been through a lot during almost eight years at goodison park , experiencing a lot of good times under david moyes and martinez , but he has not had to stand in front of the dressing room and deliver a talk to
