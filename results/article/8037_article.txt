john norrish outside exeter crown court today where he stands accused of raping a 33-year-old married woman .
a woman who alleges she was raped by a hunt master after a black-tie ball had consumed around 20 alcoholic drinks , a court heard yesterday .
the 33-year-old drank three or four glasses of wine in a pub before arriving for the ball where she drank another ` four to five wines and ten to 11 vodka and cokes ' .
on a scale of one to ten of drunkenness , she said she was ` eight to nine ' , adding : ` i was quite drunk .
' but she repeatedly rejected suggestions at exeter crown court that she had consented to sex and made the rape claims only when her husband appeared at the scene .
she denied that she stopped having sex only when she noticed one of her husband 's friends outside the vehicle who had seen the huntsman 's ` white bottom ' through the window in the dark .
it is alleged that john norrish , 67 , who was only vaguely known to the woman , approached her after her husband had left the annual ball of the tiverton staghounds at cobley farm , west worlington , devon , which was attended by up to 400 people .
she said he offered her a lift home , which she accepted , but that once they were both in his 4x4 he groped and then raped her .
norrish told police that he was impotent , and said on his arrest : ` i could not get it up .
' he later admitted having sex with the woman , saying it had been consensual .
norrish , who was master of the hunt at the time of the ball last july , denies rape .
but yesterday his alleged victim told the jury : ` he leaned across and tried to touch my neck and kiss my neck .
i asked him what he was doing .
i did not want to .
he tried to kiss me .
he was all over my face .
` i was not thinking , i
