one man 's trash is another man 's treasure , as this artist proves by building mini-mobile homes for the homeless - from recycled rubbish .
greg kloehn uses garbage like bed frames , pallets , car consoles and even washing machine doors to build his creative constructions .
the 43-year-old artist only has to buy nails , screws and glue for the colourful constructions as the rest are collected on scavenger hunts for illegally dumped rubbish .
once they are completed , mr kloehn gives them away for free to the homeless people near his home in oakland , california .
one man 's trash is another man 's treasure , as artist greg kloehn with his mini-mobile homes for the homeless .
the mobile homes made for the homeless from old rubbish in oakland , california .
the father-of-two used his first dumpster house as a second-home , until he had a eureka moment .
mr kloehn said : ` after about a week of collecting and building , i had a 21st century home , built from the discarded fruits of the urban jungle .
` this sat at my studio for a number of months , just collecting dust until one rainy night , .
charlene , a homeless woman i 've known for some 10 years , asked if i had a tarpaulin for her .
' i told her i did n't but as i went inside and walked past the home , it hit me , i should give her the house .
` so i ran back out and told her to come back tomorrow and i would have a home for her .
the next day , she and her husband oscar came round , i handed them the keys and a bottle of champagne and watched them push it down the street .
` it felt so good that i started making another one that same day .
' greg first started the project three years ago after being inspired by the materials homeless people use .
` his initial dumpster house included a camp stove for cooking , a toilet that can be hooked up to a septic tank and even a shower with hot water .
to date he has made and given away 10 of the houses and admits he now loves the reaction they get .
