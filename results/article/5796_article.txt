for most mothers , the moment when they first see their child after giving birth is filled with love and affection .
but for charlene machin , it was a moment of terror - for her son had been born with half of his face missing .
the 33-year-old had given birth to twin boys oliver and harry - but doctors discovered baby harry had been born with a severe facial deformity .
twins oliver and harry are the best of friends - with oliver fiercely protective of his brother .
charlene , with son harry , says that initially it took her years before she could love him .
mrs machin , from stoke-on-trent , recalled how , when her sons were born seven years ago , she kept apologising to husband mark after hearing the news .
she said : ` i 'd only just recovered from giving birth by caesarian to the twins .
` doctors had whisked harry straight off after his birth and i had n't been able to see him .
` the doctor lifted his hand to his own face , and made a sweeping gesture across the left side .
'' ` it 's as though his face has been erased completely , '' he told me .
he has no eye on that side , no ear or nostril .
' ' i started crying and kept saying i was sorry to mark .
i felt like it was my fault .
charlene and her two sons harry and oliver have overcome other people 's prejudices and are a loving , close family .
charlene says a turning point came when harry was 18th months old , and she explained to staring children about her son 's condition .
' i saw him the following morning and i was so shocked .
` half of his face was missing , it just was n't there .
it was like it had been rubbed out .
` as i cuddled him for the first time , waves of terror swept over me .
how could i possibly love this little boy when he looked like this ?
` people assume that maternal instinct kicks in as soon as you hold your child for the first time .
` but mine did n't .
i did n't feel anything , just emptiness .
