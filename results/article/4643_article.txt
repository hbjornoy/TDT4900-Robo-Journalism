a pittsburgh restaurant has done away with tips in favor of paying its employees salary and benefits .
bar marco is now paying workers a base salary of $ 35,000 , 500 shares of the company , paid vacation , and health care .
` it 's a huge increase , ' employee csilla thackray told reporters .
` it means that i no longer have to live with that constant fear of running out of money .
' thackray told business insider she would not have an extra $ 400 in monthly income .
in pennsylvania the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour with a $ 2.83 minimum for tipped workers .
` no one was expecting this to happen , ' thackray said .
` when you decide to make this industry your life , you kind of expect you are going to make a financial sacrifice to pursue this passion .
now i 'm getting to do what i 'm passionate about and also getting rewarded fiscally .
' co-owner bobby fry says he and his partners have been discussing changing payments for at least a year .
` the lightbulb went off , ' he said ` if we were going to offer health care , why not offer a complete employment contract , and do away with gratuity altogether ?
' he does not believe menu prices will have to change to support the new system .
employees will have to work no more than 40-44 hours per week and will get two days and one night of the week off .
they will have 10 days paid vacation .
