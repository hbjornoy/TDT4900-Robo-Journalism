adrian chiles and itv 's pundits ensured england 's euro 2016 campaign got off to a humorous start when they were soaked by a massive sprinkler .
the presenter was accompanied on basel 's st jakob-park pitch by experts lee dixon , ian wright and glenn hoddle to chat before england 's clash with switzerland .
and the four of them were drenched minutes before kick-off as swiss officials sought to give the playing surface a last minute sprucing up .
alert : the itv team realise they are about to be drenched by the errant sprinkler .
but chiles saw the funny side , joking : ` we 're going for a break , we 've just sent for a towel !
' it 's not the first time bad fortune has befallen chiles on itv duty .
getting wet : itv 's quartet trying and cover themselves from the sprinkler .
knowing look : adrian chiles turns around to see what all the commotion is about .
look out : chiles and the itv pundits duck for cover .
larking about : lee dixon , glenn hoddle and chiles see the funny side of their soaking .
he visibly struggled with the heat during england 's final world cup warm-up match with honduras in june , sweat patches showing on his shirt before the game .
and last year chiles apologised after he joked that england 's game against poland at wembley was ` practically a home game ' for the polish .
