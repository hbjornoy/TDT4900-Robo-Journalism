nearly two-thirds of young people were unable to say that the first world war ended in 1918 , as shown by a new survey .
the poll results , released in the run up to remembrance day , discovered 54 per cent of the same age range , 16-24 , also did not know the war began in 1914 .
astonishingly 12 per cent of young people thought that the battle of waterloo , fought in 1815 as part of the napoleonic wars , was part of the great war .
lack of knowledge : too many of us do not know our history - one person even thought the first world war began in 1800 .
the teenagers also seem less interested in history than previous generations , with only 48 per cent visiting their local war memorial , whereas 59 per cent of respondents across all ages had done so .
although the survey arranged by british future showed up how ignorant the nation 's youth is of history , they are not alone .
when asked by yougov , members of the public hazarded guesses as wildly out as 1800 and 1950 for the start of the great war , and 1910 and 1960 for the end date .
one in three of the public could not name the year that the war started .
the best informed age group were the over 60s .
