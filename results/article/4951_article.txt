james taylor is used to wisecracks about his height .
but when kevin pietersen 's scattergun autobiography took aim and pulled the trigger , the 5ft5in taylor looked likely to become just another piece of collateral damage in english cricket 's civil war .
now , as he prepares for england 's seven-match one-day series in sri lanka -- a tour that will help the selectors finalise their plans for the world cup -- taylor is in the mood to fire a few shots of his own .
pietersen 's disregard for taylor 's ability stems from his test debut against south africa at headingley in 2012 .
in the first innings , while pietersen was crashing a sensational 149 , taylor made 34 .
kevin pietersen was critical of the way james taylor batted against south africa at headingley in 2012 .
it was a quiet but crucial innings .
the pair added 147 .
pietersen , though , had made up his mind .
in kp : the autobiography , he writes : ` his dad was a jockey and james is built for the same gig .
we were facing the fiercest bowling attack in the world .
i did n't think he was up to it .
' pietersen took his concerns to coach andy flower , and -- after taylor was out -- told next batsman , matt prior : ` listen , batting is easy .
taylor was just making it look hard .
the south africans were laughing at him .
just relax .
' there is some dispute about whether pietersen belittled taylor in the dressing room .
but one thing is clear : a ringing endorsement it was not .
in his autobiography , pietersen -lrb- right -rrb- said that taylor was ` built for the same gig ' as his dad - a jockey .
taylor has only played two tests for england , both against south africa during the summer of 2012 .
taylor was dropped after making 10 and four in the next game at lord 's and has not played test cricket since .
he said : ` plenty of people have slagged me off behind my back and he is just another one of them .
it is plenty of years ago .
` i have n't spoken to him since and it does n't really
