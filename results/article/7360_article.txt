everton goalkeeper tim howard has advised manchester united counterpart david de gea to look upon the defensive upheaval at manchester united as a challenge to improve his leadership skills .
de gea , regarded as one of the best shot-stoppers in the world , has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury , suspension and differing formations .
howard , 35 , spent three seasons at united as a young goalkeeper and believes 23-year-old de gea needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back-four .

ahead of everton 's visit to old trafford on sunday , howard argued : ` it is easier when everything is settled in front of you , but for a goalkeeper it is part of the challenge when it 's not .
` de gea is still a young goalkeeper , even as talented as he is .
if he can learn that , how to get your point across to different players and get them to respond to you very quickly , that will be a good lesson .
` you have to use a lot of body language , when the ball is out of play and there is a lull in the crowd , you try to make your point concisely .
` you talk to players in the dressing room before the game .
you do n't want to cloud their thoughts with too many things but you get a few points across to them .
it is all a learning process .
` it feels like it was only in the last five years when i turned 30 that i started to really perfect things so it takes a while .
but some guys do it quicker than others .
