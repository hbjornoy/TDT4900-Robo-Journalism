real madrid will continue to monitor the progress of tottenham hotspur striker harry kane despite the 21-year-old just having signed a new contract that ties him to the club until 2020 .
the european cup holders know kane 's new five-year deal , coupled with the difficulty they have had in the past negotiating with daniel levy , would make him a very difficult to get inside the next two years .
but they also see tottenham as a selling club having already taken luka modric and gareth bale from them and so they will continue to watch the development of the england under 21 striker who is likely to move up to roy hodgson 's senior squad next month .

kane is already big news in madrid because of the way he has kept spain international and former real striker roberto soldadao out of the team .
representatives of the club 's scouting network have watched him several times this season , including on new year 's day when he got the first and the fourth in spurs ' 5-3 win over chelsea .
his performance at the weekend has only toughened their resolve to be part of any future race to sign him .
