goodbye mr chimp : louis as his alter ego brooke bond , which became a household name in the 1980s .
he was never a household name , yet he was the very definition of a household face .
louis the chimp , who has died at the grand old age of 37 , was famous up and down the land as brooke bond , the secret agent just as debonair as sean connery 's 007 -- with even more chest hair -- in the eighties adverts for pg tips .
it may be stretching a point to suggest brooke bond became as iconic as his human alter ego , james , but then again , it may not .
with his catchphrase ` the name 's bond .
brooke bond ' , he was voiced by the suave actor michael jayston , and became an instant hit when he first appeared in 1981 .
little wonder that six years ago , the pg tips chimp adverts , which ran from 1956 to 2001 , were voted the most memorable in tv history , narrowly ahead of the aliens advertising cadbury 's smash instant mashed potato , who laughed so rudely at earth people peeling potatoes with our metal knives , boiling them for 20 of our minutes , and then smashing them all to bits .
moreover , we did n't have to get used to a series of different faces playing brooke bond , as with 007 .
it was always louis .
and yet the fame never went to his head .
` he was quiet and calm , which is quite unusual for male chimps , ' said dr charlotte macdonald , curator at twycross zoo in warwickshire , where louis died on monday following a short illness .
` he was sociable and popular with the keepers .

dignified : louis passed away at his home at twycross zoo in warwickshire following a short illness on monday .
golden age : louis became famous as the debonair brooke bond - the secret agent even hairier than sean connery .
his 43-year-old partner , choppers , is bearing up well , dr macdonald
