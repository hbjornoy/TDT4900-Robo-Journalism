as her two-year-old daughter darcey covers her hands in paint then shrieks with delight , trish gregory looks on with amusement .
her once tidy and ordered home in newark , nottinghamshire , has descended into a permanent state of noisy chaos , since darcey and her baby sister , bea , came along .
but trish , 49 , would n't have it any other way .
trish and rob gregory with darcey , left , and bea , right , conceived their children through egg donations .
in fact , she loves being a mum so much so that she and her partner rob , 46 , are even hoping to start trying for another child next year .
by then , trish , a social worker , will be 50 , but she says her age does n't put her off .
` both my pregnancies were easy and i have plenty of energy , so why not ?
' she said .
trish conceived darcey and then bea through egg donation at care fertility nottingham .
she believed that using the eggs of a younger woman would give her a better chance of getting pregnant .
the clinic used rob 's sperm , so he is biologically the girls ' father .
but trish has never felt like any less of a mother because of the way the girls came into the world .
trish , pictured after giving birth to darcey in 2012 , said she left having children late in life as she had n't met anyone she wanted to become a parent with .
trish and rob , pictured at a friend 's wedding , started trying for a baby after they met 10 years ago but were n't able to conceive naturally .
she said : ` i carried them for nine months and gave birth to them and so they could n't feel more like mine .
` and funnily enough , darcey is blonde like me , whereas rob is dark .
she also has many of my mannerisms .
` if i have a bad day with them both i just joke that they 're nothing to do with me , ' she laughs .
like so many other women her age , trish resents the endless talk about women putting their careers before family and then leaving motherhood
