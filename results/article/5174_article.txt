a pensioner has received a # 900,000 tax bill despite living in a small terraced house on a pension and limited savings .
don yates , 72 , said he was stunned when he opened a letter demanding a payment of # 576,850.85 - a sum that left his daughter wondering if her father was a secret millionaire .
the bill arrived at his # 80,000 home in chorley , lancashire , just months after another for # 384,567.25 , which the retired councillor misread as # 384 because he had been sick with the flu .
