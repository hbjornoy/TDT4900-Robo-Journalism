her elaborate , meringue-shaped wedding gowns are on every young traveller bride 's wish-list , the unabashed stars in each episode of big fat gypsy weddings .
but when liverpudlian dressmaker thelma madine decided to teach the young traveller brides who commission her skills how to make dresses themselves , she faced her biggest , fattest challenge yet .
