bruce farrer , 72 , has given thousands of former students good cause to remember him later in life when they unexpectedly receive letters handwritten by themselves 20 years previously .
farrer , who spent much of his career at bert fox community high school , started to exercise simply because he wanted to encourage his students to write .
` i was trying to think of some assignment that would be special , and it just sort of came up , ' he recently told the national post .
by the time he retired in 2002 farrer had amassed five bins worth of letters waiting to be returned to their authors .
every year farrer sets about his task of tracking down his old pupils and this year it was the turn of the class of 1994 .

` it kind of faded from my memory , ' he told cbs news .
