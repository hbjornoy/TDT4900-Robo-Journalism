a 43-year-old anchor point man is expected to make a full recovery after initially treating a gunshot wound to the head for five days with an antibiotic ointment .
alaska state troopers say the gun went off as james doppler was handling it last weekend .
troopers say his girlfriend urged him to go the hospital but he refused , believing at the time he did n't need outside help to tend the wound .
however , in the following days , troopers say he began experiencing symptoms associated with a head wound .
alternative medicine : james doppler , 43 , shot himself with a .22 rifle on saturday and , rather than seek proper treatment , used the antibiotic cream neosporin on the wound .
` investigation revealed -lrb- the man -rrb- had shot himself in the head on -lrb- saturday -rrb- while negligently handling a firearm , ' ast troopers said in a statement .
' -lrb- he -rrb- did not seek medical attention until -lrb- thursday -rrb- .
the gun the man accidentally used on himself was a .22 long rifle .
` he was playing around with it when he shot himself , ' ast spokesperson beth ipsen told ktuu .
` nobody else -lrb- was -rrb- there at the time .
' ` no treatment before today other than he put neosporin on the wounds .
' agency spokeswoman beth ipsen in an email declined to detail the symptoms , because of health privacy laws , but said it was a ` serious , but non-life threatening ' wound .
the symptoms prompted him to seek treatment thursday at the homer hospital , where troopers took a report .
