the vase sold for 100 times its estimated value after a telephone bidder in china took an interest in it .
a small chinese vase that was valued at # 10,000 to # 15,000 has today sold at auction - for almost # 1 million .
the extremely rare 18th century ornament , made for a chinese emperor , was brought to britain by the seller 's family more than a century ago .
despite it standing just 20cm -lrb- eight inches -rrb- high , an anonymous telephone buyer from china paid around 100 times its estimated value when it went under the hammer at tennants ' auction rooms in leyburn , north yorkshire today .
tennants ' associate director , nigel smith said the blue and white bottle vase , made for the qianlong emperor around 1730 , was put up for sale by an academic who lives in oxford .
he said its auction room success was down to its rarity and exclusivity as very few were ever produced .
mr smith added : ` it really is a museum-quality piece and these things very rarely come on the market .
` it 's come down through the family - one of their relatives was a diplomat in china in the 1880s and was given it as a gift .
' he said the unnamed owner had contacted auctioneers after learning that a similar item had sold for # 2.6 million last year .
mr smith said he was shocked at the # 950,000 it made during today 's spring fine art sale , adding : ` despite the low valuation , we expected it to fetch in excess of half a million but we were very pleased with the result .
i have n't spoken to the vendor but i expect he 's rather happy too .
' the seller 's grandmother , lady ethel margaret stronge , left the vase to his mother mrs rose ethel richardson of tynan abbey , county armagh , northern ireland , who gave it to her son .
tennants were inundated with requests from people with chinese vases after they sold one for # 3million in november last year .
