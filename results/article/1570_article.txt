a vicar has ordered girl guides to quit the church headquarters they have used for 86 years -- because they have failed to attend enough religious services .
angry leaders called the reverend stephen terry ` completely out of touch ' over his decision to exclude 28 guides from a hall close to st leonard 's church in hove , east sussex .

out of touch : reverend stephen terry at st leonard 's church in hove has banned girl guides after they failed to attend some services .

he added : ` we also asked them to help out at a few church events .
