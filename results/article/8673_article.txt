his sparkling smile has already won him legions of fans and now harry styles ' pearly whites have sparked a teeth whitening craze .
not surprisingly , most of the newcomers to the beautifying treatment are teenage boys and young men , perhaps hoping to emulate the one direction star 's success with the ladies .

something to smile about : styles ' pearly whites have sparked a 500 per cent increase in whitening treatments amongst young men .
popular : along with harry 's bright whites , the duchess of cambridge 's smile was the most wanted .
what 's more , the heart-throb 's appeal is n't just confined to young men who want a girlfriend .
according to tooth-whitening company , pearlys , sales of its professional home kit increased by 18 per cent across the board - all courtesy of the styles effect .
a poll carried out by the company saw the singer revealed as the owner of the most envied set of gnashers in the country .
the duchess of cambridge took second place , while jeremy clarkson and towie star , chloe sims , received the wooden spoon prize .
pearlys founder liz ridley said : ` women are dazzled by harry 's smile and young men want to have the same effect .
` badly discoloured teeth are a complete turn off .
` it 's not a surprise a heavy smoker like jeremy clarkson came top of the worst list , while those who took part in our survey obviously think chloe simms has had too much done to her teeth .
' rotten teeth !
