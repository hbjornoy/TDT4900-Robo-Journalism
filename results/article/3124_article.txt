lifeguards located a bright purple jellyfish at coolum beach on the sunshine coast on wednesday .
` it 's straight out of science fiction , ' marine biologist dr lisa gershwin said .
` it 's an electric , vibrant , wow purple .
' she said the tentacles - or oral arms - were about a metre long and were covered in microscopic mouths .
dr gershwin , who works at the csiro marine and atmospheric research centre , said it was probably a new species because of the vivid colour .
` the colour just screams `` do n't mess with me '' , ' dr gershwin said .
` it 's not just a little purple -- this sucker is seriously purple .
' experts believe the jellyfish could be a new species because of the vivid colour .
dr gershwin believes the jellyfish could be a thysanostoma , but said the species was normally brown or beige .
` it begs the question , if it 's such a vibrant , different colour , what other features does it have ?
' she said .
` when we get it under the microscope i think we 'll start noticing all kinds of things .
' it 's rare to find thysanostoma in australian waters and even rarer to spot one off queensland 's southeast coast as they prefer the warmer tropical waters .
