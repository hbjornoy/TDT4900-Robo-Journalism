a man whose baby son went missing 21 years ago has spoken of the pain he felt as he watched officers search for the youngster 's body .
simon ward , 42 , a property developer from the north of england , flew to the greek island of kos when police from south yorkshire started digging there in october , searching for the remains of ben needham , who vanished in july 1991 aged just 21 months .
he told the daily mirror how he dressed in clothes similar to police so he could watch the dig undisturbed as it unfolded , as well as about the painful mix of emotions he endured as he watched what could have been the final resting place of his beloved son .
mystery : ben needham -lrb- left -rrb- was just 21 months old when he vanished in july 1991 .
his mother kerry grist -lrb- right -rrb- believes he is still alive .
co-operation : greek and british police worked together to search for ben , but found no trace of him .
he would be around 23 years-old now .
he said : ' i was watching every step of the way , every scoop of that digger , and it was weird because i wanted to be there , but at the same time there were heart-stopping moments when i thought they had made some kind of discovery .
' when he was not watching the dig he described how he would ` torture ' himself by revisiting places in kos that he had been with ben .
' i would torture myself going back to places where i had been with him .
really i had just one good week with him in all my time with him on kos , when we went to the beach , ' he said .

they have now returned to the uk .
painstaking : the latest search focused on a mound of soil and rubble near to where ben went missing .
