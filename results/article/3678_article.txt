a female jail worker accused of sexual misconduct was arrested on wednesday in washington county , oregon .
jill curry , 38 , was charged with six counts of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and six counts of first-degree official misconduct , sheriff 's office spokesman sgt bob ray told the oregonian .
sgt ray did not elaborate to say which inmate curry reportedly had contact with or at which jail .
however , according to the statute , the charge involves engaging in sexual acts with someone in custody .
` while there 's a presumption of innocence in our justice system , this employee is accused of extremely serious misconduct , ' said sheriff pat garrett in a statement .
` if the allegations are found to be true then this employee completely violated my trust and the public 's trust and will be dealt with swiftly and appropriately .
' the multnomah county sheriff 's office first started their investigation into curry 's actions on july 8 , when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician .
the caller has not been identified by authorities .
curry was placed on administrative leave that day , pending a criminal investigation .
she has been working within the sheriff 's office since october 2004 , serving different parts of the jail including booking , inmate units and the control center .
after her arrest , curry was booked into the washington county jail and held on $ 120,000 bond .
