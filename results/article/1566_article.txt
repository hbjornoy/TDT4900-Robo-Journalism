qpr striker charlie austin is set to miss just one match after limping away from loftus road on crutches after their 1-0 defeat to southampton on saturday .
a long-term injury to their 13-goal top scorer would have been disastrous for the west londoners in their bid to survive in the barclays premier league .
however , a statement released on the club 's official twitter account on sunday morning read : ' @chazaustin9 has suffered bruising to his right foot and will miss tuesday 's trip to @sunderlandafc .
nothing too serious #qpr .
' qpr striker and top goalscorer charlie austin could be out with injury for the rest of the season .
austin has been in superb form for the hoops this season and has scored 13 goals in 19 league games .
and austin himself followed that up by tweeting : ` scan done .
delighted to say i 've not broken a bone in my foot !
hopefully back in a week or two !
' it had initially been feared he could be out for the rest of the season after the queens park rangers striker left loftus road on crutches after the game .
the 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against southampton but was in discomfort as he left the ground .
his team-mate joey barton tweeted a picture of austin on sunday , and added : ` great to see @chazaustin9 is off the life support and is now getting his nail varnish re-applied ... ' fellow qpr player richard dunne , meanwhile , has been ruled out for three months with a knee injury .
. dunne twisted his knee and had to be substituted in the 83rd minute after a block tackle on sadio mane , who scored the winner for southampton in the 93rd minute .
qpr will be without experienced defender richard dunne for three months after he suffered a knee injury .
