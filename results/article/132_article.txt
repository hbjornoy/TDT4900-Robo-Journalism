john terry is thrilled with chelsea 's fine start to the premier league season , but insists it is still very early .
with jose mourinho 's history of claiming titles from the front , some are suggesting the blues ' position is ominous for the rest of the division , but 31 games still remain .
` clearly it -lrb- the title race -rrb- is not over , ' terry said .
` other teams have been in this position .
it 's nice to have the lead but when you 're at the top everyone wants to shoot you down .
` that 's the good thing about the premier league and why everyone loves it .
` teams are out to get us because we are at the top and playing well .
the chelsea captain said diego costa had been causing him constant problems in training .
` the international break is here and we need to come back and maintain our form after that as well .
it 's very important we do that .
' chelsea are chasing a first premier league title since 2010 - their only championship since two-time winner mourinho 's first spell ended in september 2007 - and terry wants the blues to ruthlessly exploit any slips by their rivals .
he added : ` you 're just hoping when you 're at the top and have a five-point cushion and more on certain teams , a couple of them slip up again and that increases .
` if that happens , it 's a lot of points to give up early on .
all we can do is keep winning and wait for those teams to slip up .
' terry also took time to praise cesc fabregas , who has hit the ground running at his new club .
chelsea finished four points behind champions city last term , but in diego costa now have the ` killer '
