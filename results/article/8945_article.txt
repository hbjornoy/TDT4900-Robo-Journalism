formation 4-1-3-2 -- i 'd be bold and adventurous and it would mean england either take the tournament by storm or go out in a blaze of glory as one of the best teams never to win the world cup .
joe hart .
glen johnson phil jagielka gary cahill leighton baines .
steven gerrard .
raheem sterling ross barkley adam lallana .
wayne rooney daniel sturridge .
go for broke : adam lallana should start in england 's opening world cup game against italy .
the future : the talented ross barkley -lrb- left -rrb- must be allowed to shine in south america .
the weak link is glen johnson , but if he can do something special -- like this goal for example , then that will make up for his obvious defensive shortcomings .
the key to this formation being a success over the italians lies in the three -- sterling , barkley and lallana - being so energetic that they give andrea pirlo the kind of nightmares that make him think about retiring from football .
he wo n't be able to pass a ball after being given the runaround by those three .
they will also energise and inspire wayne rooney , who is a striker with an incredible goalscoring record .
he slows down in the no 10 role or out wide , so play him up front with another goal machine daniel sturridge -- they score goals , and goals win matches .
it 's not rocket science .
right-back : liverpool defender glen johnson could be england 's weak link in manaus .
goal machine : wayne rooney must play up front with daniel sturridge to take the game to italy .
