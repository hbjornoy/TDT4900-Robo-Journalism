a polar explorer whose charity .
trek across the greenland ice sheet turned to tragedy has been left in .
agony due to the severe frostbite he suffered , his best friend said .
today .
andy norman , 33 , of bracknell forest .
near ascot , was one of three men whose tent was ripped apart as storm .
winds of up to 95mph howled across the barren , frozen landscape .
his companion on the trek , philip .
goodeve-docker , 30 , froze to death before rescue teams were able to find .
them , and he and third team-member roan hackney are being treated for .
frostbite .
mr norman was last night on high doses .
of morphine to numb the excruciating pain of his injuries as he .
recovers in an icelandic hospital , said his friend georgina lilley from .
wokingham .
she told the evening standard : ' i .
spoke to him last night and he was in a lot of pain .
he had asked them .
to lower his morphine dosage and i could tell he was in pain .
` it 's very typical of him because he .
is very fit and health conscious .
i expect he will recover quicker than .
most and might even be back in a week or so .
` he just wants to get home but so far we do n't know for sure when that 's going to happen .
' the it worker and his two companions .
had been on a 370-mile unsupported trek across greenland 's frozen .
interior to raise money for charity when they were caught in .
unexpectedly bad weather .
fierce winds ripped away part of the .
tent , leaving the three men exposed to the freezing gale and .
temperatures plummetting to minus-35c .
they radioed for help , but it .
took rescue teams 24 hours to find them .
