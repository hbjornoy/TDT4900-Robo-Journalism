his duties have been taken up by motor boats and now he just swims for fun and allows divers to have a dip with him .
photographer wolfgang zwicknagl , from austria said it was amazing what a good swimmer this huge animal is .
wolfgang , 40 , said : ` we have been told that rajan goes swimming in the sea just two or three times per month .
` he is not forced to go into the water and if he does n't want to , then you dive alone .
water baby !
now rajan just swims for fun and allows divers to take a dip with him .
the 64-year-old animal moves perfectly in the ocean and uses his trunk as a snorkel .
` but when his mahout brought him to the beach , he stood there for a minute , took a breath and walked into the ocean .
` it is almost impossible to explain how amazed we were when he started the dive with us .
` he moves perfectly in the ocean , using his trunk as a snorkel and moved much quicker than we expected , so taking photos was surprisingly exhausting .
` the tips of his tusks have been cut slightly as he had some difficulties moving his trunk .
' wolfgang added : ` rajan is a retired working elephant who
