a child protection expert has warned that the bbc 's multi-million pound inquiry into the jimmy savile scandal is ` too narrow ' to uncover the truth about the dj .
mark williams-thomas gave several hours of evidence to the dame janet smith review last week and is the first of its more than 140 witnesses to speak publicly about the experience .
he said dame janet ` will never get to the bottom of what is really known ' about savile because her inquiry 's remit does not extend far enough .
an expert has claimed the bbc 's probe into savile 's crimes is ` too narrow ' to uncover the whole truth .
the former surrey police officer added : ` i have enormous respect for dame janet smith .
however , it 's quite clear there is a lot of information out there her inquiry is not aware of .
' he said he believes the former appeal court judge , who can not compel anyone to appear because of her inquiry 's non-statutory nature , may be ` frustrated ' by this and urged for an ` overarching ' inquiry .
he added : ` there 's a significant amount of information that is slipping through the gap .
' the smith review , due to report this summer , was set up by the bbc to examine its culture and practices when savile was there .
