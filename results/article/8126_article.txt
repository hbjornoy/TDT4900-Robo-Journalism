this time last year , tahysn was a happily married father of two little boys aged three and four and lived close to his large , extended family in the village of shangal in iraq 's nineveh province .
now , home is a ramshackle refugee camp under the protection of kurdish peshmerga fighters and he is grieving the loss of his wife and sons .
his story is far from unique .
like so many other yazidis , his family were massacred by isis jihadis as they swept through northern iraq in august .
like them , tahysn has lost everything .
scroll down for video .
tragic : tahsyn shows a photo of his two little boys .
it is all he has left of them after they were murdered by is .
` when the daesh -lrb- a local slang term for isis -rrb- came to our village , i was not there but called my family and told them to leave .
it was a big shock for everybody .
` they managed to escape the village but on the way to mount sinjar , they met daesh .
all of them were killed .
' his eyes glistening with tears , he adds : ` my older brother , my father , my mother , my wife and even my two kids were killed .
all i have left of them is just one picture on my mobile phone .
` the daesh are just savages .
they do not respect religion or humanity .
they are not humans - even animals have more pity .
' the first inkling that his formerly peaceful existence was coming to an end arrived when mosul fell to the jihadis on june 10 .
as isis cut a swathe through the local population , forcing christians to flee and killing anyone who resisted , the yazidis watched uneasily .
gone : nasser , from the village of kocho near sinjar , shows a photo of his small nephew who was killed .
grieving : sefan , 16 , is now without his father -lrb- pictured -rrb- and three brothers - all of whom were murdered .
all that 's left : this man 's brother was killed by the jihadis .
this photo is all he has to remember him by .
alone : just eight years old
