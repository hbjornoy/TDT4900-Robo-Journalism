the mother of a boy who was seen banging his head against a window at his north brisbane home has been charged with child cruelty .
a neighbour saw the two-year-old boy ` screaming , crying and headbutting ' the window for up to two days at his home from may 3 to may 4 .
ms mckinley said the two-year-old boy was autistic while his older brother , who was aged four at the time of the abuse , may also be autistic .
the court heard evidence from the two-year-old boy 's foster mother and sister , who claim the little boy is often seen curled up in the foetal position and is easily frightened .
there was previous evidence of neglect at the house that was known to the department of child safety but the woman was only standing trial for the abuse in early may .
the boys were found naked in the filthy house in keperra on a cold may morning .
the smell of urine and faeces made the police officers physically gag as they rescued the boys .
while the mother 's layer lewis shillito admitted that there was evidence of a ` lack of care ' in the house , it was not possible to determine whether the boys would suffer mentally because of the abuse .
however , judge judith daley said it would be the jury 's decision what harm the neglect has had on the two boys .
a date for the woman 's trial has not yet been set .
