sir bruce forsyth has said that sometimes it can be ` more cruel to do nothing ' than to let someone die , as he spoke out today in support of assisted dying .
sir bruce said his experience of nursing first wife penny calvert -lrb- pictured here with the couple 's three children -rrb- as she suffered with dementia had convinced him of a need for a change in the law .
he said : ` it 's a terrible illness , awful to see and awful for everyone close to the person suffering .
` it 's a very difficult situation .
she did n't remember me .
it 's just so awful to have your mind and your memories taken away from you .
` it bothers me an awful lot that people are just left to suffer .
if i had alzheimer 's or dementia i would do something about it .
` the law should be changed and if people want to die with a bit of dignity left they should be able to do so .
` if it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing .
i 'd like that right for myself .
' sir bruce married ms calvert in 1953 , and the couple had three children together before splitting 20 years later .
