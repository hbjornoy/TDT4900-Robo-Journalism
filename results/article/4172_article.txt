the footage begins with the team looking out through the plane 's hatch over the californian city of san diego .
dramatic : as they approach their target - the san diego padres ' home ground at petco park - the roar of the crowd below can be heard getting louder .
their target - the san diego padres ' home ground at petco park - is a mere speck in the distance .
then they jump .
circling above california 's second largest city , the roar of the wind is replaced by the roar of the crowd , growing louder as they approach the stadium .
roaring wind : the team of three comprised jim woods , who wore the head-cam , vic maldonado and brad woodard , who both carried flags , one bearing the late jerry coleman 's initials and one with his trademark star .
t marks the spot : all three land within a yard of their target to wild cheering from the fans .
the jump was in honour of baseball legend jerry coleman , a new york yankees second-baser who was named the major league 's most valuable payer in 1950 and manager of the padres in 1980 .
he died on january 5 this year .
