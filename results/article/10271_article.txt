it appears the government 's key budget plank of a $ 7 gp co-payment is dead in the water , or at least , that 's what clive palmer believes .
` we 're not going to have a co-payment of even one cent , ' mr palmer said .
` there 'll be none .
is n't that good ?
' this news came as a hammer blow for the government , which was still talking up a possible deal as latest as this morning .
` all of australians do n't need to worry any more , ' said the billionaire mp .
` the co-payment is dead .
we wo n't be supporting it .

the co-payment is dead .
billionaire mp clive palmer has delivered the bad budget news to the government today that ` we are not going to have a co-payment of even one cent ' tony abbott was still talking up a deal on the medicare co-payment plan as late as this morning ` that is what we 're working towards ' .
that was until clive palmer arrived to tell the coalition that ` the co-payment is dead , we wo n't be supporting it ' mr palmer continued , suggesting the co-payment had now been consigned to history .
` you can talk to all the analysts and crunch all the numbers you want but the fact of the matter is the palmer united senators will not be changing their position and the co-payment will not be getting through .
` we have been inundated with calls from real australians and the message is very clear that they do not want it .
` it is another cost they simply ca n't afford and the palmer united party can not allow more pain to be inflicted on ordinary australians who are already doing it tough under tony abbott .
` low income earners , single parent families , pensioners , nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged will be hardest hit by a gp co-payment .
` it is a ruthless attack on australians when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget .
`` there is zero chance of the palmer united party supporting it
