arrest threat : helen perry who joked on facebook that she would squirt out the olympic flame with her son 's water pistol .
a mother-of-two who joked on facebook that she would squirt the olympic flame out with a water pistol was given a police warning .
helen perry , 36 , was threatened with arrest after writing that she had her son 's water guns at the ready after learning that people who live 60 miles away had been chosen to carry the torch through her hometown .
she also said that she would blockade the route through bridlington , east yorkshire , until they chose a local person to take part in the relay .
several weeks after posting the light-hearted comments on a local newspaper page , she received a call from police .
' i could not believe what i was hearing when i answered my phone and it was the police calling about what i had written on facebook , ' said the former care home manager .
` at first i thought it was a joke .
` the officer i spoke to warned me that if i carried out what i had joked about online then i would be committing a criminal offence and would be arrested .
' i understand that security is very tight at the moment what with the olympics and the queen 's jubilee but this was very clearly a joke .
` bridlington is quite a small place .
and it was just like we were having a conversation between friends on .
