the suspect in the 1979 kidnapping of six-year-old etan patz in new york will learn today whether his confession can be used at a murder trial .
pedro hernandez , 53 , has pleaded not guilty to killing the boy , who disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in manhattan , in a case that mystified police for decades .
it was only in 2012 that hernandez , who had been a stock clerk at a store in etan 's neighborhood when the boy disappeared , emerged as a suspect .
pedro hernandez , who admitted to killing etan patz in 1979 in a taped confession , appears in manhattan criminal court with his attorney harvey fishbein in 2012 .
after six hours of questioning , he confessed to the kidnapping on video , telling police he lured etan to the store basement with the promise of a soda and then choked the boy .
he described putting the six-year-old , who was still alive , into a plastic bag , then putting the bag inside a box and dumping it nearby .
' i was nervous ; my legs were jumping , ' hernandez said .
' i wanted to let go , but i just could n't let go .
i felt like something just took over me .
i do n't know what to say .
something just took over me , and i was just choking him .
' a judge is due to rule , not whether the statements are true , but whether or not the confession can be used as evidence at hernandez 's murder trial .
judge maxwell wiley must decide whether hernandez was properly advised of his rights and is mentally capable of understanding them .
etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk carton , and the day he disappeared , may 25 , became national missing children 's day .
his body has never been found .
