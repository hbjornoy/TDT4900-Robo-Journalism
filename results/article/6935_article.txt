thomas hitzlsperger says it would have been almost impossible for him to come out as gay had he still been playing professionally .
the former aston villa midfielder , who retired from football back in january , believes that he could n't of come out as homosexual during his time as a player because of the media .
he told the metro in a q & a : ' i did so many interviews and it took up all of my time so it would have been difficult to go back into training as if nothing had happened .
proud : thomas hitzlsperger is the only openly gay player to have played in the premier league .
` for me it would have been almost impossible had i still been playing -- not because of the fans or the other players , but because of the media .
' the 32-year-old is an ardent supporter of the stonewall campaign -- a lesbian , gay and bisexual rights charity in the uk -- which helps tackle homophobia in football .
and the former germany international says players should show their support to the campaign this weekend by wearing rainbow laces .
respect : hitzlsperger spent short spells at everton and west ham , as well as four years at aston villa .
he added : ` it would show there is no place for prejudice in football .
last year everton , one of my former clubs , wore the laces which was great .
` some players may not want to because of their personal beliefs , and we must respect that , but it is great to see so many players and clubs getting involved .
' as well as hitzlsperger a number of arsenal players have pledged their support to the rainbow laces campaign , including england duo theo walcott and alex oxlade-chamberlain , as well as qpr midfielder joey barton .
