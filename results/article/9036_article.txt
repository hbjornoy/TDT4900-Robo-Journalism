alan shearer has posed on twitter wearing one of rio ferdinand 's ' 5 unity ' caps .
the former manchester united defender must be incredibly persuasive .
the duo are currently sharing a sofa as part of bbc 's world cup coverage , but with the quarter-final game between brazil and colombia being shown on rival broadcaster itv , there was clearly time for the team -lrb- and robbie savage , spotted in the background -rrb- to unwind in rio on saturday night .
ferdinand tweeted : ` oi oi go on big al in the # 5unity !

day job : rio ferdinand and shearer sitting either side of ruud guulit during bbc 's world cup coverage .
posers : thierry henry and ferdinand snapped with the cap .
backing : robin van persie supporting his old man utd team-mate whilst signing autographs .
the cap was released by ferdinand as part of his fashion range , with his trademark ' 5 ' logo featuring a montage of every nation 's flag featured in this summer 's world cup .
and shearer 's not the first to be snapped wearing the cap , with the likes of robin van persie and thierry henry also among those to have donned it .
for the former england striker , however , it seems a little more like a mixture of the brazilian weather and a saturday night on copacabana beach had a bit of a part to play .
but let 's face it , we 've all been in holiday pictures that we 'll live to regret in time to come .
