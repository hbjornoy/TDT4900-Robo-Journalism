almost 35 years have passed since i tried to exchange sterling for roubles at the reception desk of a moscow hotel .
it was a modest sum , about # 30 , but the receptionist became agitated .
` do n't change here !
' she whispered .
` we pay only the official rate .
' ` where , then ?
' i asked .
she pointed across the lobby at a figure in a sombre green jacket , with stiff-brimmed cap and face blank as an empty soup plate .
` him !
' she said .
` he pays six times the rate .
' she reached for my notes , and hurried across to the militia man .
they held a brief conversation , the transaction was made , and she returned , smiling .
` he asked me where you are from , and i told him britain , ' she said .
` he said he likes british , so he gave me seven times .
' fifa president sepp blatter announces qatar as the hosts for the 2022 world cup in december 2010 .
sepp blatter -lrb- right -rrb- hands the world cup to qatar 's sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani .
she picked out her own , modest , commission , and handed me a bundle of roubles .
the deed was done .
it was all perfectly open ; nobody reacted , nobody seemed to care .
that was the way life was lived in soviet russia .
i repeated the performance three or four times over the period of the moscow olympics .
the man would nod to me as i walked through the foyer ; occasionally he would pat the wallet in his inside pocket .
i told myself that , while illegal , it was harmless , a victimless crime which everybody committed .
it was several weeks later , when the olympics were over and i was back home , that the doubts started to crowd in .
of course russian society was hopelessly corrupt from top to bottom .
but through my complicity in that tacky deception , had n't i helped to make it a little more squalid ?
which brings us , quite naturally , to england 's hapless bid to stage the 2018 world cup .
