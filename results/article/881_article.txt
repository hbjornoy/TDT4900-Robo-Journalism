a drunken man in east london staggers all over the footpath before clinging onto a railing for dear life in this video as some observers in a nearby house record him in his inebriated state .
the man , dressed in a red t-shirt and navy shorts , looks like he is trying to walk somewhere but every time he tries to walk forward he loses his balance and he has to hastily retreat and grab the railing .
at the start of the video the man is having such difficulty walking up the footpath it looks like he is walking on black ice .
one of the men who is recording the footage says : ` oh he 's going backwards , oh do n't hit your head .
' on five occasions the man tries walking forward during the two minute video but each time he reaches a stage where his legs seem to take on a life of their own .
the revellers in the nearby house laugh incessantly as the drunken man fails to walk forward time and time again .
one man sings mockingly , 'cause i take one step forward and two steps back , ' during one of the drunken individual 's more spectacular unsuccessful attempts .
moments later the drunken man clings to the railing once again and falls to his knees .
pensive : the man gathers his thoughts before he tries to walk forward .
wobbly : as the man walks forward his legs start to wobble like jelly .
balance : the inebriated man 's balance is also very poor and he constantly loses his footing .
railing : the man constantly leans on the barrier as he uses it as a crutch to stay upright .
stumble : the man , who is trying to walk in east london , stumbles numerous times during the short video .
break : the man appears to take a break for a few moments at one stage while leaning on the railing .
quicksand : the man 's ability to walk is so hazardous it looks like he is walking on quicksand at times .
sleep : the drunken man looks tired and he puts his head bag momentarily as he tries one last attempt .
