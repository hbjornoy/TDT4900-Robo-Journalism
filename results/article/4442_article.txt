wayne rooney might have missed a few chances at one end of the pitch for manchester united on sunday but he was lucky not to give away a penalty at the other .
from a tottenham corner late in the second half , rooney grabbed hold of harry kane and hauled him to the ground , but referee jonathan moss did not award a penalty .
' i do n't know what guidelines are going to make it any better , ' said former fulham captain danny murphy on match of the day on sunday night .
` it is a penalty , he 's not looking at the ball and he 's denied him an opportunity to get on the end of the corner .
