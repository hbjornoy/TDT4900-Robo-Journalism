tragic : mountain bull , the 46-year-old creature that inspired save the elephants , has been found dead .
the six-tonne elephant became the face of the save the elephants campaign in october 2012 .
prone to ploughing down anything from huge trees to man-made barriers , he had been attracting the attention of poachers for years .
in a desperate bid to protect the magnificent creature , conservationists gave mountain bull a tracking device to identify his natural migration path .
they then built a ` wildlife corridor ' between mount kenya and the northern rangelands , previously blocked by human development .
the six-tonne african animal had been attracting poachers ' attention as he was prone to ploughing through things .
an inspiration : charity workers across the globe have paid tribute to ` his bravery and resilience ' and to dissuade him from crushing fences , they sawed off part of his tusks .
a spokesman for lewa wildlife conservancy project in north kenya said : ` mountain bull 's death is a great loss to the conservation fraternity .
` he taught us much about elephant and animal behaviour , migration routes and patterns , and to a large extent , left many inspired by his bravery and resilience .
