brian houston , the son of hillsong founder frank houston , has told a hearing about the moment he found out his father was a paedophile .
mr houston , the church 's senior pastor , first heard the allegations levelled by aha - the name for the alleged victim - in late october 1999 during his weekly meeting with general manager george aghajanian .
he said he did not immediately report the incident to the police as he did not want to ` pre-empt ' the victim .
during the pivotal meeting , mr houston said he and mr aghajanian were discussing other matters until mr aghajanian said : ' i need to talk to you about something else .
` it 's not about you , it 's about your father .
