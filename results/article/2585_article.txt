father-of-two john stoner , 42 , dug up the extremely rare new england coin in a field outside the village of king 's clipstone in nottinghamshire .
when it was minted 350 years ago , there would n't have been much change from a slap-up meal and a few of pints of ale .
today the silver threepenny coin that amateur treasure-hunter john stoner dug up in a farmer 's field would probably buy the entire farm .
the extremely rare new england coin , bearing the date 1652 , is expected to sell for up to # 1million when it is auctioned .
it has been hailed as one of the finest examples of a currency produced in the days of the pilgrim fathers in a land that would become the united states .
how the 17th century threepenny bit ended up in the village of king 's clipstone , nottinghamshire , is not known but last night coin collectors from around the world clamoured to buy it .
mr stoner , who temporarily mislaid the coin at one point , found it while on an outing with the coil to the soil metal detector club on sunday .
the 42-year-old father of two had only just started to sweep an area of the ploughed field when he picked up two signals from the detector .
the first was from a random piece of metal ; the second was from an uneven , hand-hammered coin , about the size of a modern 1p but thinner , buried five inches deep in a clod of earth .
` i dug up the soil and out it popped , ' he said of the historic find .
` at first i did n't think it was anything special .
i knew it was n't english , but just how important a find it was , i did n't have a clue .
' the club immediately posted a picture of the coin on its facebook page and invited followers to identify it .
within five minutes , they were inundated with replies .

' that evening mr stoner took it to his worksop home , put it in a jar and showed it to friends .
in the morning , he could n't find it .
