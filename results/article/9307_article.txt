do n't get me wrong , i am not marouane fellaini 's biggest fan , but if manchester united are to win on sunday then he is going to have a big role to play .
you would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become united 's go-to man but he has knuckled down , worked hard and is now one of louis van gaal 's most effective players .
here 's why ... target man .
2,251 - burnley .
2,241 - qpr .
2,226 - manchester united .
united have played the third-most long balls this season , so this is not the skilful , free-flowing team of previous years .
but with fellaini it is an effective tactic .
he has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season -- far more than any other united man -- and crystal palace 's mile jedinak is the only midfielder to win more headers per game .
his power in the air is vital for providing knock-downs for the likes of wayne rooney and juan mata to collect .
liverpool must also track his runs into the box because united will try to find him as often as they can .
marouane fellaini , pictured during training , has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season .
fellaini is a powerful player that has become a key part of louis van gaal 's united team this season .
power play .
one thing is for sure with fellaini , you know you 're in a game with him .
martin skrtel , emre can and mamadou sakho are big , physical players but they will have a battle on their hands .
fellaini gives away on average 2.1 free-kicks per game -- that 's the fifth-highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is .
it 's not pretty , but it unsettles defences .
united midfielder fellaini will not be afraid to get physical with liverpool 's players at anfield .
touch of class .
fellaini 's game is not all about power .
like peter crouch , he 's portrayed as a bit of a lurch when actually his technique is good .
just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against tottenham .
he might not be the creative
