wales defence coach shaun edwards has claimed his players are the best in the world at competing for turnovers .
the former rugby league star , whose side beat scotland on sunday , believes the likes of sam warburton and jonathan davies are more potent at the breakdown than richie mccaw 's all blacks .
the tackle area is a fundamental part of test rugby and edwards was full of praise for his side 's efforts after their victory at murrayfield .
` i was very impressed with our post-tackle work , ' said edwards .
` we turned them over six or seven times and it 's something we excel at .
i think we are the most proficient side in the world at turning teams over on the floor .

edwards believes sam warburton -lrb- left -rrb- and jonathan davies -lrb- right -rrb- are better than likes of richie mccaw .
edwards ' claims may seem punchy , however wales have topped the turnover statistics in their recent tests against england , south africa , new zealand and australia .
much of the breakdown work comes down to the referee 's interpretation and wales got on the right side of new zealand official glen jackson in edinburgh .
` the best part of our game was dan biggar , jamie roberts and leigh halfpenny being fearless and leaping in the air , ' said edwards .
` dan biggar has got such guts .
he is fearless .
' biggar is wales 's first-choice no 10 , with gareth anscombe and rhys priestland his main rivals .
there have been strong calls for the inclusion of leicester 's owen williams ahead of the world cup but the 22-year-old was yesterday ruled out for nine months after knee surgery .
` it 's massively disappointing news for owen , ' said leicester director of rugby richard cockerill .
