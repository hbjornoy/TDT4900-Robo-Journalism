the moment a firefighter saved a tiny kitten from a burnt out house and helped bring it back to life has been captured on his helmet camera .
cory kalanick was at a blaze in fresno , california , when he spotted the lifeless body of the kitten on the floor of the house .
sadly the kitten did not survive the night , but the touching efforts of mr kalanick led to a donation of two animal oxygen masks to help with future rescues .

and that 's when i saw the cat and grabbed him , ' he told cbs 47 .
mr kalanick , who always wears a camera on his uniform , used a tank of oxygen in his attempts to save the animal .
the kitten was laid on a glove to protect it from the hot sidewalk , and water was poured over its body to try to revive it .
mr kalanick , who has been a firefighter for ten years , said his crew mates teased him a little at first , but added : ` it 's a pretty cool thing that we get to help a kitten out .
' he put an edited version of the rescue on his youtube page .
children who saw the apartment blaze last month said it was the second rescue for the kitten , who had previously been discovered abandoned in a shopping cart .
