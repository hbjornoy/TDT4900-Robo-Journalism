the mistle thrush is fast disappearing from the uk 's gardens , wildlife experts warned today as they urged people to take part in an annual survey to collect information about bird species .
results from the rspb 's annual big garden birdwatch survey have shown that mistle thrushes are now being seen in fewer than half the number of gardens they were spotted in 10 years ago .
the rspb is urging the public to take part in this year 's survey , which takes place this weekend , to help gather important information on how mistle thrushes and other garden bird species are faring .
under threat : sightings of the mistle thrush are down 28 per cent between 1995 and 2010 and wildlife experts are asking the public to look out for them and other birds in the annual big garden birdwatch survey .

since starting in 1979 it has helped highlight dramatic declines in some garden birds .
starling numbers have fallen from an average of 15 per garden in 1979 to just three in 2012 , while house sparrow numbers have fallen by two-thirds in the same period , although the two species are still the most commonly seen .
but some birds have seen their fortunes improve , with garden birds such as blue tits , great tits and coal tits on the increase since 1979 .
and goldfinches , which were absent from the big garden birdwatch in its early years , have featured regularly in the top 15 species spotted since 2004 .
