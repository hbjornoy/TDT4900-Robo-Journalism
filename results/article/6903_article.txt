it could just be the worst ever counterfeit - but this photocopied # 20 note still managed to fool staff at one shop .
police in manchester revealed that the counterfeit cash had been accepted by a shop as legal currency over the christmas and new year period .
the fake money , which was just two colour photocopies of a # 20 note loosely stapled together , is understood to have been printed on normal paper and cut to size .
police have released a photograph of what could be one of the worst ever counterfeit bank notes .
the staples are clearly visible , as are white lines across the note - possibly as a result of the printing process .
it was handed in to greater manchester police after being used to buy products in recent days .
police refused to name and shame the shop that accepted the fake note .
but it said that they were publicising the incident to ` raise awareness ' .
the gmp city centre twitter feed published the photograph at around 3.30 pm on wednesday with the caption : ` hard to believe that this was accepted as legal currency .
` wo n't name and shame establishment to avoid embarrassment .
' it later added : ` not naming premises !
it 's a reminder for vigilance for all .
' the gmp city centre twitter feed published the photograph at around 3.30 pm on wednesday along with this message .
the bank of england 's # 20 note officially changed in july 2010 .
from july 1 of that year , only notes featuring the image of scottish economist adam smith could be used .
they replaced notes featuring the image of edward elgar as part of a move to drive down the number of forgeries .
meanwhile britain 's first plastic banknotes are set to enter circulation in march 2015 .
two million of the # 5 notes will be released by clydesdale bank to coincide with the anniversary of the opening of the rail bridge in east scotland in 1890 .
they will be introduced in scotland ahead of england , where the bank of england plans to issue them for the first time in 2016 .
