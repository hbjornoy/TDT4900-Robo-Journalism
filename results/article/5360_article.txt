sir alex ferguson said in his autobiography that letting dutch centre half jaap stam leave was his biggest mistake - but it must have been run close by the signing of bebe .
the portuguese forward 's nightmare spell at old trafford is finally over as he joins benfica in a deal worth up to # 2.4 million - four years after united 's legendary boss spent # 7.4 million on him without even watching a video .
the deal represents a # 5million loss on the initial investment - but reds fans will just be happy to see their most ridiculed purchase through the exit door .

oh bebe please do n't go : the portuguese forward was a joke figure at old trafford .
and if he finally reaches the potential that one of ferguson 's most trusted scouts had in him , united will be in line for a 50 % sell-on fee of any future transfer deal for the 24-year-old .
united paid vitoria de guimaraes # 7.4 million for the striker in 2010 , but he only started three games - all in the cup competitions .
he made seven appearances in total but never looked like making it into the united first team and he was shipped out on loan to besiktas , rio ave and pacos de ferreira .
flop : just three first team starts in a united shirt hardly made bebe good value for his # 7.4 million price tag .
