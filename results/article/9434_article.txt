concern : david baddiel .
david baddiel has dismissed claims that ethnic origin entitles tottenham fans to call themselves the ` yid army ' by insisting only ` three or four per cent ' are jewish .
tottenham rallied around their supporters , after society of black lawyers chairman peter herbert urged police to prosecute those who hold aloft banners bearing the name ` yid army ' and chant it during games .
club bosses welcomed the police response that there was ` no deliberate intent to cause offence ' and that it was more a form of self-parody by a predominantly jewish support .
but baddiel , the comedian and writer who is himself jewish and a fervent chelsea fan , is adamant such a line of defence was factually incorrect and that anti-semitic abuse should be stamped out wherever it occurs .
` the idea that spurs fans are reclaiming the y-word and are entitled to because so many of them are jewish is simply not true , ' he said .
` there are only 250,000 jews in britain as a whole and i 'd say about three or four per cent of tottenham 's crowd is jewish .
` that means well over 90 per cent of those chanting `` yid army '' are not actually jewish and that is just one of several reasons why it can not be right .
if , for instance , there was a team in brixton called brixton united , and they had a mainly white support who adopted the n-word as their badge of honour and went round chanting `` n ***** army '' , they would be closed down tomorrow .
` at tottenham , the club 's `` jewishness '' is just an historical association with the area .
it 's doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual jews in the ground at home games -lrb- only 0.4 per cent of the uk is jewish -rrb- .
so the argument `` but it 's just like snoop doggy dogg using the n-word '' does not apply to most spurs fans .
