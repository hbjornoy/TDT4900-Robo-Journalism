roy hodgson has poured scorn on the notion that swearing during a press briefing after the 1-0 friendly win against norway last week was a sign of the pressure getting to him .
the england manager has been in the spotlight ever since england 's awful world cup display , in which they picked up just one point and scored twice , their worst performance at a world cup finals since 1950 .
it led him to use the words ` f ****** b ******* ' after the norway game when he was asked if he was worried that statistics from the game showed england had two shots on target .
hodgson regularly berates the use of stats , considering them an unsophisticated reading of the subtleties of the game .
and he laughed off the fact that he had sworn , admitting that he even does so in front of his wife .
furious : roy hodgson swore during a press conference after england 's win over norway .
` that 's ridiculous , ' he said , when asked about his language .
` goodness me .
what sort of world are we living in ?
you are scraping the bottom of a barrel to say something negative there .
` listen , i 'm a football coach .
i worked most of my life , up to the age of 25 , in england .
i played in non-league with dockers whose every other word was a swear word .
they did n't even know they were swearing because they did n't know any other words .
` if you say : `` we are very , very annoyed and morally offended by hodgson , the england manager , using a swear word .
and we insist that in the future he never swears , '' then , ok , i will never swear in your company again .
` i just thought i was with people mature enough to understand that a swear word , which i thought was probably used at the right time , should not provoke a fit of moral indignation ... i was n't arguing with anybody , i was making my points .
is this the way to victory ?
