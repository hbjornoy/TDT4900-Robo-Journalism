evie tucker , 4 , suffers from cerebral palsy and can only shuffle a few steps at a time in her walking frame .
she will be unable to walk without an operation costing # 30,000 - the amount well-wishers have raised .
but her local nhs trust ruled that evie 's case was not strong enough to justify the cost .
her determined family ploughed straight into fundraising for the four-hour operation themselves in a bid to help evie walk before she reaches school in september .
her story was featured on mailonline in january and the money was raised in just seven months .
evie 's mother karissa skidmore , 28 , said she was so grateful to the fundraisers and looking forward to evie dancing and playing like her friends .
she said : ` it 's brilliant , amazing .
i ca n't even describe how it feels to know we have got the money now and are just waiting for a date .
' i did n't think we would be able to do it so quickly and thought it would take about a year .
everyone has been amazing and i do n't think there was an event we had to plan for ourselves .
` people just rang us and said they were doing this and doing that and took over all of it , which was really helpful .
for people to take that stress away from us was wonderful .
` there have been people we do n't even know who have donated a lot of money and we can not thank them enough .
