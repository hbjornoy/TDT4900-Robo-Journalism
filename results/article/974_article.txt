patsy coleman , 48 , found out she had tumours in both of her breasts after being randomly called up to attend a breast cancer screening early .
a mother-of-two was shocked to discover she had cancer in both of her breasts , after being randomly selected for a cancer screening programme .
patsy coleman , 48 , was n't due for a breast screening until her 50th birthday under national guidelines , but was called up early as part of a pilot scheme into early screening .
a mammogram revealed that mrs coleman , from stoke gifford in brisol , had a cancerous tumour in her right breast .
after undergoing a double mastectomy operation to remove both her breasts , surgeons discovered she had a second tumour in her left breast .
mrs coleman , who works as a cashier and receptionist , has now recovered and is urging the government to lower the screening age for all women .
she said : ` the shock of being told i had breast cancer was one thing - but that it was likely i had developed a bi-lateral cancer that can affect both breasts was devastating .
' i went through a whole journey of emotions , from anger to panic .
' i could n't think straight and thankfully my sister julie was with me through all these stages , helping me to come to terms with it all and giving me support and guidance through hospital and at home .
` my consultant could see i was upset and he turned to julie and said : `` it 's ok , i can fix her '' .
' i tried to remain upbeat through it all and now i 'm back to full health more or less .
' i think they should reduce the screening age - it made a huge difference to me .
it was n't my time to go .
` it is difficult to say what would have happened if i had waited to 50 and it makes me feel sad when i think that i was saved , but another woman elsewhere might not get the same chance .
' six breast screening units in england took part in the early testing pilot scheme , which invited a selection of women aged 47 to 49 to have early testing .
