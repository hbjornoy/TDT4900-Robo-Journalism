frustrating : claire lennon will have to wait for her pet sarah to die before she can get her earring back .
an unlucky woman whose pet cockerel swallowed her diamond earring will have to wait until it dies to retrieve her precious jewellery .
claire lennon from berkshire lost her earring when cockerel sarah pecked it off while perched on her shoulder .
she will have to wait eight years to get her hands on the # 300 present that her partner adam , 38 , gave her again .
vets say it is trapped inside the stomach of six-month-old sarah and will not come out .
claire , also 38 , said ` the vet said he could operate to recover the earring , but that might kill sarah , which would devastate our six-year-old daughter mia ' .
` so we 'll have to wait till sarah gets old and dies , but they live to a ripe old age - we are probably looking at another eight years before i get my earring back .
' sarah , who is in fact a cockerel despite having a hen 's name , is a family pet who loves sitting on claire 's shoulder at home near newbury .
claire explained : ' i felt this sudden sharp pain in my ear lobe and realised sarah had gobbled down the earring ' .
she and adam , an it specialist , put the chicken in a cage and spent the next few days searching the floor in case the earring had passed through the chicken .
` but there was sign of it and mia 's friend 's father , who 's a vet , said it might have got stuck in the gizzard .
' irretrievable : a vet 's x-ray shows the diamond earring inside sarah , which would be too dangerous to cut out .
` we spoke to another vet , carl gorman , who said he would do an x ray .
` the x ray showed it was stuck firmly in the gizzard so carl gave sarah some laxatives , hoping it would pass .
` but it did n't work , it 's still stuck fast and we have accepted it is trapped inside and wo n't come out .
