warren buffett 's cash-laden investment house berkshire hathaway announced thursday the purchase of battery maker duracell in a $ 4.7 billion deal with procter & gamble .
rather than pay cash , berkshire will give p&g $ 4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world 's largest consumer products company .
berkshire hathaway said it will pay the us consumer goods giant for duracell with $ 4.7 billion of its own p&g shares .
ahead of that transaction , though , p&g has committed to inject $ 1.8 billion into duracell to recapitalize it .
billionaire warren buffett , ceo : p&g will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by berkshire hathaway .
those shares are currently valued at about $ 4.7 billion .
duracell is one of the world 's leading battery brands , acquired by p&g in 2005 as part of its takeover of shaving goods group gillette .
the company reportedly has 25 percent of the global battery market with $ 2 billion in annual sales , producing from three factories in the united states , one in belgium and one in china .
' i have always been impressed by duracell , as a consumer and as a long-term investor in p&g and gillette , ' berkshire founder and chief executive buffett said in a statement .
` duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products , and it will fit well within berkshire hathaway .
' the transaction announced on thursday helps p&g chief executive a.g. lafley streamline his cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue .
p&g 's better-known products include tide laundry detergent and pampers diapers .
buffett , meanwhile , avoids a big tax bill that omaha , nebraska-based berkshire might have incurred if it sold its p&g shares .
both p&g and berkshire shares hit a record high this week .
final deal : proctor & gamble will contribute about $ 1.7 billion to the duracell business before the deal closes .
buying duracell is a ` brilliant move , ' said doug kass , who runs seabreeze partners management in palm beach , florida , and is a longtime berkshire critic who is selling its shares short .
