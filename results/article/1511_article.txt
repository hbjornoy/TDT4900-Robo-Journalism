zeb was about to be euthanized by vets at the spca in new jersey when he was taken in by city of elderly love , an organisation which cares for senior pets .

and after appearing in one of its videos , the animal , aged around 12 , was picked up by beth flor from spring city , pennsylvania , to add to her family of four .
` he 's really affectionate .
he 's just happy to have blankets to lie on and peoplea to give him some affection , ' mrs flor told abc news .
the family already had a cat and three dogs when zeb was brought home before christmas .
` my kids absolutely adore him .
it 's hard to get photos of him because i get on the floor to get a photo and he immediately runs over .
' mrs flor , who previously volunteered at a shelter for elderly pets , said she hoped more people will adopt senior animals which also need homes .
` just because an animal may not look like the obvious choice for adoption does n't mean he or she wo n't be perfect for your family .
` people like an underdog , i think .
' alongside mrs flor 's two daughters , the cat now must get used to another feline and three dogs .
