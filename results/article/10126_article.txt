a council which banned apostrophes from the names of new streets because it did not want to baffle residents with punctuation has decided to reverse the decision .
the leader of mid devon council said he would be recommending to the ruling cabinet that the policy was changed so that apostrophes would again be used .
councillor peter hare-scott said he did not find it acceptable that incorrect grammar was being used on the council 's street signs .
change : mid devon council has reversed its decision to ban apostrophes from the names of new streets .
it means apostrophes such as the one seen on an avenue in devon will also be placed on new signs .
it followed a storm of protest last week when the policy to ban apostrophes was revealed .
` the convention not to use apostrophes when naming new streets has been in place since long before this administration took over , ' councillor hare-scott said .
` personally i 'm not happy about using english that 's incorrect and do n't find this acceptable .
` we are reviewing the situation and i shall be recommending to cabinet on march 28 that they amend the policy so that street names may indeed in future have apostrophes .
' the proposed naming and numbering policy document states streets should not be given names ` that may be considered or construed as obscene or racist ' , while those ` that may be open to re-interpretation by graffiti or shortening of the name shall be avoided ' .
baffling : residents slammed mid devon council for issuing the bizarre guidance .
it adds : ` in order to avoid causing offence either by inclusion or exclusion , no street shall be named after any living person .
` all punctuation , including apostrophes , shall be avoided .
' last year book retailer waterstones removed the punctuation from its brand name .
