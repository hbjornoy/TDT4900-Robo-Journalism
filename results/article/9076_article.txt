jamie redknapp told me his knee man , richard steadman , was the best in the business but our first meeting was n't quite what i was expecting .
` steady ' makes his judgments based on what he sees inside the knee during surgery and also on what he feels by touching the knee .
agony : bullard is helped off after suffering another injury in 2009 with hull .
i thought i was there for surgery so when , during our first meeting , he turned off the light in the room and began feeling my knee , i thought ` is this guy a bit of a weirdo ?
' luckily , he was not .
in fact , he was as good as he was cracked up to be .
soon after surgery , my physio luke and i unwrapped the heavy bandaging on my knee .
it was a horror show .
my knee was five times its normal size , there was an enormous scar stretched right across it and it was bright red .
i was close to tears and said to luke : ` there 's no way i 'm coming back from this .
' and then , just at the point where i was feeling like throwing in the towel , a man hopped into the room walking on what looked like two paper-thin , artificial legs .
the curse returns : bullard was haunted with injuries throughout his career in england .
it was as if he 'd been sent there especially for me .
i was crying by now as i looked up and studied this bloke .
` f *** this , ' i thought as i watched the guy struggling to adjust to life with no legs .
` what am i worried about ?
