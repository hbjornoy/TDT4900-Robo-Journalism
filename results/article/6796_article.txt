they may look good enough to eat , but these images of realistic-looking meals are actually made entirely of lambswool .
from the great british fry-up to a traditional roast dinner , art director and model maker jessica dance has recreated beloved classic dishes to scale - in a format not safe for human consumption .
each tiny baked bean is individually sewn and yarn colour is alternated to show grill marks on meats , making the brightly-coloured reproduction dinners hyper-realistic , and also cartoon-like ; what a perfect diner advertisement might resemble .
the comfort food series is a knitted project by jessica dance with photographer david sykes - the burger came first .
the project is a collaboration between ex-fashion student dance , 26 , from east london , and photographer david sykes , 38 , from london .
aptly called comfort food , the series aims to encapsulate the mood of the classic british caf√© , fast food joint and burger van - but with a woolly twist .
the burger meal - ` fast food reimagined ' - .
was knitted first .
it features individually knitted fries in a red chip box , a mounded burger bun encasing a beef burger , and meticulous .

it features a cup of tea , toast , beans , tomato , egg , sausage , bacon with fat , mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale from representative multicoloured yarn .
