jose mourinho tore into his ` lazy ' chelsea team at half-time to inspire the blues to the top of the barclays premier league with a 2-0 win over leicester .
chelsea laboured in the first half against newly-promoted leicester before mourinho 's tirade sparked them into life and goals from diego costa and eden hazard sealed victory at stamford bridge .
the improved performance did not , however , spare the team from post-match criticism .
laboured : diego costa gave chelsea the lead but the hosts made hard work of leicester .
come on lads : jose mourinho cut a frustrated figure during the first half at stamford bridge .
mourinho , though , was not happy with the slow start .
he said : ' i prefer to train in the morning , but this week i trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football , you get lazy .
` this weather pushes players to be a bit lazy , to lose a bit of tension , a bit of sharpness in your body , after that you pass slow , you do not react to the second balls , the time goes on and on , then when you wake up , it is half-time .
get in there : but he had plenty to celebrate in the second half as the blues went onto win 2-0 .
tetchy : chelsea and leicester players argue after a bad challenge by dean hammond on andre schurrle .
` in the first half , the team was lazy , and i did not like that .
` but they improved in the second half and they won , which is the most important thing .
` at half-time , we had to be a bit emotional with them .
i told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game and that we were at risk .
` it is impossible to play football if you do not win one second ball , it was basic but important things .
'' mourinho continued : ' i told them if you have the same feeling and vision i have , we are not in trouble , because we change , but if you do not agree , we are in trouble and do not win the game
