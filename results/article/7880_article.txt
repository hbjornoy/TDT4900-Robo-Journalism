british comedian harry enfield has upset his primrose hill neighbours with plans to turn a local pub into a # 3 million house for him and his family .
comedian harry enfield 's plans to convert a pub into a # 3million family home have angered his neighbours .
he bought the queens last year with the intention of living upstairs while a friend ran a restaurant downstairs .
but he wrote to neighbours saying the plan was not financially viable and he would convert the whole building into house .
former regulars at the pub , in primrose hill , north london , said the conversion would ruin the ` strong sense of community ' on the street , while a local councillor called the move a ` tragic loss ' .
mr enfield and his wife lucy , a designer , currently live in west london and bought the property with the intention of moving when their three children -- aged 15 , 13 and nine - finish school .
in a letter to local residents , mr enfield , 51 , pointed out that his family had lived in the area for years .
the actor , who famously played kevin the teenager and wayne the slob , said : ` i have been a resident of primrose hill since 1988 , my family since 1929 .
' if the council did not grant permission for the change of use to a home he would consider other options , he said , but warned ` every other option would take time and stretch us financially ' .
he added : ` there are two other pubs within 50 yards , four other pubs within 150 yards and six other pubs within 300 yards , we would imagine the council might think the loss of this one not to be too great , the compensation being greater tranquillity .
' the pub 's former landlord tony peters , who ran it for 32 years before his retirement last year , expressed concern that mr enfield 's plans would change the nature of the street .
