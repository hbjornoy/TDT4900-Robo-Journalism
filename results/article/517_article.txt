a student has been fined for driving a car without any doors , lights or bonnet - and using his arms to indicate when turning .
sam wilson mistakenly believed the peugeot 306 was still legal to drive , despite the missing doors , headlights , indicators , bonnet and brake lights , because it had a valid mot certificate .
the 25-year-old drove the car , described by police as a ` skeleton of a vehicle ' , for almost three miles before he was pulled over .
wilson , who studies electrical engineering at college and works part-time as a pizza delivery man , was attempting to take it to a recycling centre five miles from his home in bingham , nottinghamshire , to sell for scrap .
he had already removed a selection of parts to sell online .
` skeleton of a car ' : sam wilson , 25 , was pulled over by police while driving this peugeot 306 which had no doors , headlights , indicator , bonnet or brake lights .
mistaken : the father-of-two , who removed the car parts so he could sell them individually for more money , claimed he thought he could still legally drive the car on public roads as it had a valid mot .

he was also ordered to pay # 120 costs and given three penalty points on his licence .
after the hearing , wilson said : ` the car did n't have any lights on it , but my argument was that it was daylight .
it did n't have any signals either , but i used arm signals to indicate .
