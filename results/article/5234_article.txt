sunderland striker connor wickham is considering a move abroad to try and recapture the ` golden boy tag ' that saw him tipped at one time to become the best english striker since wayne rooney .
wickham , still only 21 , was watched by every big club in the premier league including manchester united and chelsea as a teenager at ipswich before joining sunderland at 18 in a deal that could have reached # 8million .
but the england under-21 striker has scored only 10 goals in 60 games in three seasons for the blackcats and spent time on loan to sheffield wednesday .
sunderland striker connor wickham is contemplating a move broad when his contract expires .
the 21-year-old has scored just 10 goals , including this one against manchester city , in 60 appearances .
with his contract due to expire in the summer , the strapping 6ft4ins centre-forward is able to negotiate with foreign clubs in the new year and it 's an opportunity he plans to take .
despite his youth , wickham does not feel it is too early to sample life overseas and follow the example of ashley cole and gareth bale who are enjoying their time in europe .
sunderland manager gus poyet would like to persuade the striker to stay after he played a key role in helping them avoid relegation last season .
he said earlier this season : ` connor is a player he wants to keep , a massive part of our miracle great escape last season and he is a very important part to our plans .
' wickham was part of the sunderland team humiliated 8-0 in their last away game at southampton a fortnight ago and a repeat performance at crystal palace on monday night could lead to poyet 's departure .
wickham was considered one of the hottest properties in england but has struggled to assert himself .
the england under-21 striker can talk to foreign clubs in january and could sign a pre-contract .
