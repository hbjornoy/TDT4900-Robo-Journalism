sometimes it 's better to be lucky than good .
christmas came two days early when the nhl 's buffalo sabres won in overtime on what is likely the most unusual goal ever scored in hockey history .
monday night 's game against the phoenix coyotes was tied 1-1 in overtime when goalie mike smith 's save of a sabres shot sent the puck straight up into the air -- what happened next may never happen again .
scroll down for video .
what goes up , must come down : the puck goes straight up in the air before landing in the back of phoenix coyotes ' goalie mike smith 's pants .
swing and a miss : coyotes center martin hanzal -lrb- 11 -rrb- tries to swipe the errant puck out of the air but misses .
the puck went straight up into the air for what must have seemed an eternity to the coyotes ' martin hanzal .
the center tried in vain to swipe the puck away from the goal as it tumbled back down to the ice .
the puck then somehow ended up in the back of mr smith 's pants .
look !
look !
: buffalo sabres players shout to the refs and point at the puck sitting in the back of mr smith 's pants .
is it a goal ?
: the referee can clearly see the puck in the back of mr smith 's pants - and across the goal line - but a video review was used to confirm the score .
without a clue as to where the puck was , the goalie instinctively backed into the net to block whatever shot may have come at him .
that 's what cost his team the game .
when he backed into the net , his pants crossed the goal line -- with the puck inside .
multiple sabres players began shouting and pointing at the puck inside the net while in the goalie 's pants .
a video review confirmed the goal , giving the sabres the bizarre win .
clearly a goal : though video replay was used to confirm the goal , the puck is clearly visible inside
