rob green made the save , but eduardo vargas had as much to do with alexis sanchez 's missed penalty as his qpr team-mate did .
arsenal forward sanchez stepped up to take a penalty inside nine minutes of the boxing day london derby but little did he know his chile team-mate eduardo vargas was signalling to green which way to dive .
vargas was clearly seen pointing to rangers no 1 green to tell him which way to dive and the former england no 1 duly obliged , leaping to his left to keep out the spot-kick .
sanchez and vargas are close friends having played together for chile since 2010 , but the arsenal hitman may have to be more wary about what he divulges to his compatriot in future ... eduardo vargas -lrb- bottom left -rrb- flags to rob green to get his attention as alexis sanchez lines up his penalty .
vargas then points to green to tell him which way to dive for his international team-mate 's penalty .
sure enough , sanchez went the way vargas pointed and green guessed right .
green gets his hand down to thwart sanchez and keep the score at 0-0 .
