star-struck grandmother jill stolworthy -lrb- pictured with her husband david -rrb- drives around with a life-sized dummy of sir cliff richard .
jill stolworthy and her husband david found the bizarre head dummy at a car boot sale and attached it to body made of mdf .
the couple snapped up the pop star 's head at a car boot sale in 2012 before giving him a body made from mdf with a cushion ` to give him a bit of chest ' .
they then used one of mr stolworthy 's old navy blue blazers , which was destined for the charity shop , and a norwich city football scarf to dress the doll .
the model also sports a pair of aviator sunglasses - because the stolworthys say his eyes are too intense to look at .
mr stolworthy said : ` we got the head because we like cliff richard - jill especially is a big fan - and it just escalated from there .
` we thought he would be particularly useful when jill is driving on her own , especially at night , so it looks like there is a male passenger .
' the dummy accompanies the pensioners to the shops and trips to see friends .
and , fittingly , he goes on their summer holidays as well .
mrs stolworthy has loved sir cliff , 73 , since she was a girl and has seen him sing all over the uk .
she often plays his music in the car , with his lookalike perched on the back seat and says the doll makes her feel safe when she is on her own .
