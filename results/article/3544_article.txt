murdered : homeless kevin bennett , 53 , was kicked to death by three youths for a dare .
three boys who beat a homeless man to death for a dare were convicted of murder yesterday .
the teenagers - two aged 14 and a 17-year-old who can not be named because of their ages - attacked kevin bennett , 53 , as he slept rough outside a supermarket in liverpool .
mr bennett died in hospital six days after the beating in the early hours of august 17 last year .
during their trial at liverpool crown court , the jury was told the 17-year-old had goaded one of the 14-year-olds in to the attack by saying : ' i bet you have n't got it in you to do him in ' .
the court heard the younger boy later told his friend : ' i started kicking him , i booted him and now he 's dead ' .
the second 14-year-old acted as a look-out as the attack took place , the prosecution said .
the three boys had denied murder but were convicted today by a unanimous jury of seven women and five men following 13 hours of deliberations after a four week trial .
the first 14-year-old closed his eyes and put his forehead against the glass dock as the verdicts were delivered .
the two other boys showed no emotion .
in the public gallery , members of mr bennett 's family sobbed .
the boys shared the dock with linda doran , 42 , from liverpool , who was convicted of perverting the course of public justice by providing false alibis for two defendants .
all four were remanded in custody for sentencing in the week commencing april 15 .
trial judge , recorder clement goldstone qc , ordered psychiatric and psychological assessments of the boys to be carried out by a expert adolescent psychiatrist .
convicted : all three teenagers - two aged 14 and one 17-year-old - denied murder but were found guilty by a jury at liverpool crown court .
