a mother who lost her young son in a tragic accident is now running a single-handed campaign to get statutory bereavement leave extended for parents who lose a child from the current three days to at least four weeks .
lucy herd 's 23-month-old son jack drowned in their garden pond in august 2010 when lucy took her eyes off him for just a short moment .
on top of the unimaginable grief , lucy discovered that as a bereaved parent her then-partner could take just three days paid leave off work - one of which had to be for the funeral .
lucy with jack at the seaside : jack drowned in a tragic accident and lucy 's partner , jack 's father , was given just three days off work .
any additional time was to be taken as either sick leave or holiday .
this compounded the pain of the grieving process and left both parents without the support of the other at a time when both were incredibly fragile .
` as a mum my world died the day jack died , ' lucy said .
` it was every mother 's worst nightmare : i took my eyes off jack for those split moments and he wandered away from my protection .
' jack with his older sister elle : there is currently no specific law granting time off for bereavement .
' i do n't really remember the days straight after jack 's death , i remember feeling a pain like no other , i can honestly say my heart physically hurt and that hurt is still there but trying to make a positive heals me slightly .
` when my family all left as they had to go back to work as their bereavement leave had ended i felt alone , lost and abandoned , how on earth was i going to continue to live without their support and love around me 24/7 ?
` but i did live and i have survived , and i 'm now campaigning for other parents not to have to worry about losing their jobs after a death of a child .
it is a great healing process as is
