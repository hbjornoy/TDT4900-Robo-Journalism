rumours were rife in a slovakian town this week when a river running through turned bright red .
the river in myjava , a small municipality on the border to the czech republic , had changed colour over night and turned into ` blood ' .
police have been called in to investigate the matter , but it is believed to be a faulty filtering system from a slaughterhouse upstream .
riverrun : residents in the small town of myjava in slovakia awoke to a river red as blood .
roman podbrezova , 65 , had gone for a .
morning walk when he saw the drastic change to the river which runs .
through the centre of the town .
` i just could not believe my eyes , ' he said .
` the river was dark red .
it was like something from a horror film .
blood cascading through the centre of town .
' another local said : ` this is really creepy .
yesterday evening i walked past here and it was its normal colour .
` now .
it looks like someone slaughtered 1,000 virgins or something .
i 'm not .
superstitious , and we 've never had any serial killers or anything like .
that here , but this is n't normal .
` slaughter of 1,00 virgins ' : locals feared the colour change was an result of mass murder or ` evil ' , although the most likely explanation is that of a broken filtration system at a nearby slaughterhouse .
police spokesman elena antalova said : ` we are checking the source of the blood and what caused it .
` at the moment we are thinking it could have come from dead fish or maybe someone washed a barrel containing blood in the river .
` it seems it came from the drains directly above the museum , ' she said .
the waste from a slaughterhouse higher up the river myjava is usually pumped into a retaining pool where it is filtered before being released into the river .
