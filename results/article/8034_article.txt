a retired nhs manager came within inches of death after a bullet was fired at him during a struggle with a gunman at a luxury holiday hotel .
peter norledge , 70 , and his wife christine were staying at cape town 's waterfront victoria junction as part of a 48-strong british tour group .
the couple were enjoying a late night cup of tea just before retiring to bed when a man knocked on their door claiming he was there to check a problem with the ventilation .
recovery : british tourist peter norledge , 70 , was left inches from death after battling a hotel room intruder who beat him around the head with the gun barrel .
brave : the armed robber had tricked his way into mr norledge 's luxury hotel room in cape town , south africa , where he had been staying with wife christine .
recalling the struggle from his hospital bed , mr norledge , from derby , said : ` it sounded like housekeeper who had just delivered us some milk for our tea .
' i thought he had come back for some reason .
but it was a different bloke who said he had come to check the ventilation .
i let him in and the next thing i knew i was looking down the barrel of a gun .
` he instructed my wife and i to lie face down on the bed but i refused .
he then pushed me and demanded money .
i opened the room safe and he grabbed two bags of jewellery i had just purchased .
' i was n't prepared to let him take them so i tried to hold on to his wrist and he then grabbed my wallet .
i then tried to grab that back from him and that 's when we started fighting .
' i was afraid but i also did n't want him to get away with it .
but he got the upper hand when he started to hit me with the barrel of his gun .
blows rained down and i covered my head with my hands .
` then a shot went off .
