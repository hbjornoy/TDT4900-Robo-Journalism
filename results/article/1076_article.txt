the first lesson in driving is figuring out which pedal makes the car go , and which makes it stop - but most of us know which is which well before we get behind the wheel .
it seems to be a point that 16-year-old andrew burbridge missed since he pressed the gas pedal instead of the brake in a driving lesson yesterday , sending his father 's toyota camry into a gas station convenience store .
and it turns out he did n't even have a learner 's permit .
whoops : 16-year-old andrew burbridge was getting a driving lesson from his father yesterday when he accidentally drove through a gas station convenience store .
andrew was getting a driving lesson from his father john around 4pm , when he drove through the front door of the hess express in valrico , florida .
according to hillsborough county sheriff 's deputies , andrew pulled up to the store and was attempting to park when he hit the gas again instead of the brake .
while a picture of the crash scene shows that the car made it all the way inside the store , it did n't hit any of the customers inside .
before : what the hess express convenience store looked like before andrew burbridge crashed through the front door yesterday .
one customer was scratched in the arm from a soda display stand and another woman was taken to brandon regional hospital for neck and back pain after being pushed out of the way by the man who got scratched in the arm .
mr burbridge 's toyota camry incurred about $ 6,000 damage in the crash , and the damage to the store is about $ 5,000 .
both burbridge men were cited for the accident - andrew for driving without a valid license and john for permitting an unauthorized driver .
