huddersfield will be without their inspirational captain danny brough for thursday 's qualifying super league play-off at wigan .
the reigning man of steel was forced to sit out the giants ' final match of the regular season against st helens last friday after taking a blow to his testicles in the previous game against hull .
brough , who was forced to spend a night in hospital , has made progress in his recovery but will not be risked against the defending champions .
huddersfield will be without their captain danny brough for thursday 's super league play-off at wigan .
` broughy is a tough old bloke and it takes something pretty bad to sideline him or put him down but he has improved and we will put him back in when the time is right , ' said huddersfield coach paul anderson .
` we have proved that we can win without danny brough , as good a player as he is .
and , as much as we miss him , it 's somebody else 's opportunity .
' teenager jake connor stepped into brough 's stand-off role and scored a try and kicked two goals in the giants ' 17-16 win over saints that guranteed them a top-four finish .
anderson 's options are increased with the return of full-back scott grix , who has missed the last two games with a groin injury , while prop eorl crabtree also returns after sitting out last friday 's match with a minor knee injury .
wigan 's only absentee is centre iain thornley and coach shaun wane is set to stick with the team that beat warrington 24-20 in their final league game .
` it 's good at this stage of the season to have a very strong squad to choose from , ' wane said .
` i 'm happy to be able to name the same 19 players again after the injuries we have had this season .
