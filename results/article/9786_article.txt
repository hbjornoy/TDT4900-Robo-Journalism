asda bosses forced a british legion poppy seller to leave their store - because it clashed with the rota of other charity collectors .
the shocked collector was unexpectedly marched from the supermarket in chapeltown , south yorkshire , and told not to return for a week .
david roussell , local legion secretary , said : ` we were shocked a poppy seller had been turned away and she was upset at being asked to leave the store .
` we always collect at the asda store for two weeks , so not allowing us to collect there for one of those weeks could affect our collection total .
` we send letters to supermarkets around july letting them know we intend to collect , and someone went and agreed it verbally at the asda store , ' said mr rousell .
collector jacqueline stenton was representing the british legion at the supermarket when she was unexpectedly turned away on october 25 .
asda managers said they could n't allow a poppy seller that week because it clashed with a calendar of other charity collectors who stand outside the store .
mr roussell said the store had always allowed poppy sellers in the past and collectors had not had any trouble until ms stenton was turned away .
an asda spokesman confirmed its stores have a calendar of charity activity to avoid clashes .
` across october our stores fundraise for breast cancer awareness month , and there were also two local charities collecting in store at this time .
` as per every year the royal british legion is welcomed into our stores from november 1 to 11 .
we 're pleased the team has been in store since saturday .
