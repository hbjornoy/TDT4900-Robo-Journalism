less than 12 hours before i 'm due to have a c-section to bring my twin daughters into the world and i 'm on the phone to my younger sister abigail , begging her to come to my flat .
sensing the urgency in my voice , she drives across south london to be with me .
naturally i 'm restless .
like any mother-to-be , i want my babies to arrive safely .
but i 'm also concerned that a vital piece of equipment , one that will smooth my ride into the first few days of motherhood , has broken .
luckily my sister has a spare .
a breast-pump , perhaps ?
maybe a nappy-disposal system ?
er no ... hair straighteners .
less than 12 hours before she was due to have a c-section to give birth to her twin daughters , jill -lrb- pictured -rrb- asked sister annabel to borrow her hair straighteners .
the fact that i was even thinking about my hair when my main focus should have been my babies came as no surprise to my family .
for decades , they have listened to me moan about my mop of unruly curls .
it 's not only that it has more twists and turns than an underground map , but it 's thicker than the entire cast of made in chelsea .
if i was going to look anywhere near presentable in the post-partum snaps , it was going to need straightening .
was i being ridiculously vain ?
absolutely .
but i also knew that by fighting the frizz , i 'd feel more in control as i embarked on the overwhelming journey into motherhood .
it will come as no surprise that once charlotte and martha arrived , and were then whisked off to the special care unit because they were premature , i barely gave my hair a second thought .
and since that day i can count on one hand the number of times i 've sported straight hair .
as a result , i 'm finally coming round to the curly mane that used to be the bane of my life .
like jill , nicole kidman has tried to hide her curly hair by straightening it .
seems i 'm not alone .
