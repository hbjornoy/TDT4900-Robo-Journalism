manchester united have agreed to sell chile striker angelo henriquez to dinamo zagreb for a fee in the region of # 1million .
henriquez cost # 4m when he moved to old trafford in the summer of 2012 from universidad de chile but never played a competitive game for united , scoring once in a pre-season friendly against swedish club aik a year later .
he went out on loan to wigan athletic and real zaragoza before making a season-long move to zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season .
manchester united striker angelo henriquez will join dinamo zagreb on a permanent basis in the summer .
united signed henriquez , pictured scoring in a pre-season friendly in august 2013 , from universidad de chile .
the deal included an option for the croatian side to sign henriquez permanently in the summer , and coach zoran mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed .
with so many star names in louis van gaal 's squad , henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from old trafford .
` we have bought him outright , ' said mamic .
` taking henriquez depends on us , not on manchester united .
we took him with the right of first refusal , which stands at around $ 1.5 m -lrb- # 1.1 m -rrb- , and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer .
there is no longer any doubt -- he is ours and the story is resolved .
' henriquez could n't compete with the likes of wayne rooney -lrb- left -rrb- , radamel falcao and robin van persie -lrb- right -rrb- .
