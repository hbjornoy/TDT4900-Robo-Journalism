as hitman : absolution 's release draws ever closer , mailonline caught up with the game 's star , david bateson - the long-standing voice of agent 47 .
is it the darkest hitman game yet ?
bateson : ` you know what , i think they 're all pretty dark .
i have n't seen the whole game , but yes , it 's fair to say that the darkness of it , the element of suspense , fear , death and destruction is the worst ... or the best .
' legend : agent 47 is one of the most recognisable characters in video games .
how has the character evolved since you have played him ?
bateson : ' i think the history and the back story of his creation has been developed more and i think it has also evolved .
' i do n't even know to what extent the creators had worked it through from start to end or whether they 'd gone from one game to the next , but i definitely think this game has a much more personal human element to it .
' i thought blood money really was pushing it with advancing that human element with his relationship with diana , however this one takes it to the next level .
' do you feel like agent 47 has any weaknesses and are these explored in absolution ?
bateson : ` weaknesses , well maybe killing people !
you know , i do n't know .
` i 'd say his only weakness may be that he might sometimes get a bit curious as to how he goes about killing someone or where that level could lead him to .
` but then a weakness in this game might be his evolving relationship with one of the characters .
' looks that kill : absolution is the most graphically accomplished hitman yet .
agent 47 has a dry sense of humour .
are there any elements of the character that are similar to you ?
bateson : ` yeah , a lot , actually .
i kill people for a living , i have to admit it -lrb- laughs -rrb- .
