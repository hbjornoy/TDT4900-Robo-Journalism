unflattering : robson is not flattering when reminiscing about his former recording boss .
he compared simon cowell to a groper fish .
simon cowell helped make robson green and his soldier soldier co-star jerome flynn huge singing stars in the 1990s .
but robson is not flattering when reminiscing about his former recording boss .
` when i caught my first groper fish on extreme fishing , it reminded me of simon , ' he said .
` with all the cosmetic surgery he 's had , he is looking more like a groper fish .
` he looks as if he 's been shot out of a cannon .
' the actor also reveals that the song .
that sealed robson and jerome 's recording success , unchained melody , was .
almost never made .
at the time soldier soldier was one of the most popular shows on tv , with 17.8 million viewers .
in a 1993 episode , a band did n't turn up so the pair sang the song .
but it was two years before it was released as a single .
` i did n't want to sing .
i was already being paid a fortune for what i was doing but simon would n't let it go , ' said robson .
` he was pestering my mother all the time , wanting me to sing that bloody song with jerome .
' i .
got a lawyer to stop him ringing her , then i called him myself and told .
him , `` if you do it again i will take this to court .
` this is .
harassment .
'' then .
simon said , `` can i just say , i will give you this amount of money if you .
record the song .
'' the amount was in seven figures .
. .
of course i .
said yes .
