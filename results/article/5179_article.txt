even mercedes motorsport boss toto wolff suggested ferrari 's success was ' a wake-up call ' to his organisation .
without doubt mercedes , and hamilton in particular , responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate nico rosberg at the end of fp1 when pirelli 's medium-compound tyre was used .
switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in fp2 , hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443 secs over ferrari 's kimi raikkonen .
red bull 's daniel ricciardo was third quickest , 1.093 secs adrift , but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues .
