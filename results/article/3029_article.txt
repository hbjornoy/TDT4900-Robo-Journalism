a russian motorist was left stunned after he found a cat stuck in the most unusual place - his jeep 's suspension spring .
vitaliy bouranin , 32 , said that he had n't noticed anything when he 'd climbed into his toyota land cruiser to set off on a business trip in sakhalin , russia .
but after travelling for 50 miles at speeds of over 80mph he decided to stop at a petrol station to fill up .
stuck in a rut : the cat had managed to get himself in a tight spot but mechanics still tried to free him .
tightly wound : this little cat looks unmoved by all of the attention he is receiving to free him from the suspension spring in russia .
helping hand : one man shoves his hand right into the spring in an attempt to push the cat out .
he said : ` as i was filling up , i heard a noise that sounded like a cat meowing .
i thought it might be under the car so when i put the fuel nozzle back i looked under the car and could n't see it , but i could still hear it .
` after a little poking around i finally saw a patch of fur and realised the cat somehow ended up inside the spring .
' i have no idea how long it was there , or far more importantly , no idea how it got there .
i would have said it was impossible for a cat to get in the middle of a spring like that but somehow it had managed it .
' you 're free : the cat appears to have a stretch as he is released from the spring after being stuck in a cramped position for a very long time .
nine lives : this cat had a lucky escape after being driven 50 miles unnoticed .
he quickly asked an attendant for help , but he could n't get the cat out .
staff then called the police and fire service who eventually decided the only thing to do was dismantle the car and remove the suspension spring .
surprisingly , the cat stayed calm throughout the three-hour ordeal to free him .
he was then put into a box so he could be taken back to the
