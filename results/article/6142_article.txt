young thugs : the police are hunting these baby-faced robbers after a 12-year-old schoolboy had his bike stolen during an attack earlier this month .
the boys , who are both white and described as being about 15 years old , ran off into the woods .
one had ginger hair and freckles and the other had blonde hair .
the victim was not seriously injured .
detective constable mike keogh of greater manchester police , said : ` what is immediately striking - and concerning - is just how young these two robbers appear .
` they have been described as being 15 or 16 years old and while their baby faces give them a younger appearance we have been able to compile two very realistic images and i am certain someone in the local community will recognise them .
` if you are able to identify someone from these images - be it a neighbour friend or relative - please get in touch .
