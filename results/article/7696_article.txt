tv watchdog ofcom has rejected complaints that comedian ricky gervais 's use of the word ` mong ' during a stand-up show was offensive .
the office star and controversial comedian claimed that britain 's got talent singer susan boyle looked like a ` mong ' during his ` science ' live show on channel 4 last year .
during a tirade about the scots singer in october , gervais said : ` she would not be where she is today if it was n't for the fact that she looked like such a f ***** g mong .
' controversy : gervais , seen here in a picture posted on his twitter feed , branded susan boyle a ` mong ' and repeatedly used the term on the micro-blogging site last year .
outspoken : the comedian , pictured hosting the golden globes last week , was described as ` exploratory and subversive ' in an ofcom ruling today .
` when she first came on the telly , i went , `` is that a mong ?
'' you all did .
' the jibes saw charity bosses write to gervais to demand he stop using the word , which they saw is a cruel nickname for down 's syndrome sufferers .
ofcom launched an investigation , but today cleared channel 4 of breaching guidelines on offensive content .
the tv regulator ruled that although gervais 's comments could cause ` considerable offence ' , they were justified in the context of a late night comedy show .
ofcom ruled that gervais 's jibes towards susan boyle were ` justified in the context of provocative comedy ' during the show , gervais went on to say that he did n't mean boyle had down 's syndrome , and argued the word ` mong ' was no longer associated with sufferers of the condition .
ofcom said that in the name of freedom of expression , no word was banned after the tv watershed .
however , there must be a good reason for using language many people find offensive .
the regulator 's own research found that many people did not know of ` mong ' came from the term ` mongoloid ' -- an offensive term for people with down â€Ÿ s syndrome -- but it ` could cause considerable offence to those who are aware of
