gunman : michael atherton shot dead three women then turned the gun on himself at a house in horden , peterlee , on new year 's day .
triple killer michael atherton was ' a good man ' - according to the daughter who he almost killed in his new year 's day gun attack .
laura mcgoldrick , 19 , was slightly wounded but managed to escape the slaughter in horden , peterlee , county durham by climbing through an upstairs window .
but atherton , 42 , shot his partner susan mcgoldrick , 47 , her sister alison turnbull , 44 , and niece tanya turnbull , 24 , shortly after returning home from a pub that evening .
he blasted them with his licensed shotgun before killing himself .
a joint statement from laura and her brother , michael atherton jnr , paid tribute to all four who died in the shootings .
` we are truly devastated , ' they said .
` me and my sister have lost the best mother in the world .
we do n't understand why my dad would do anything like this as he was such a good man .
` at the end of the day we have lost four loved family members and we hope they are all at peace now .
' mr atherton 's parents , peter and christine , said : ` we and our whole family want to express our sympathies to the families of susan , alison and tanya .
` although we loved michael , we are sorry for his actions and do n't understand why he did what he did .
` we dearly loved susan as a daughter for over 20 years and are devastated by the loss .
' the tributes come after it emerged police seized atherton 's shotguns three years ago -- but returned them to him because they did not think he posed a danger .
officers were called out to his home on september 10 , 2008 , and removed six guns from atherton 's home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself .
he applied to get them back and they were returned to him
