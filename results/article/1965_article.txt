' bordeaux manager willy sagnol , the former france and bayern munich right back , wants to bring sanogo to the stade chaban-delmas with his side sixth in ligue 1 and ten points off marseille at the top .
wenger could be more inclined to let sanogo head to france with plenty attacking cover at his disposal with joel campbell and 19-year-old chuba akpom recently coming off the bench .
