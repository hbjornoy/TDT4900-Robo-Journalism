the villa forward was sent off for using ` excessive force ' in a challenge with ashley young but the united player later told brad guzan he expected the foul to be awarded villa 's way .
lambert expressed his pleasure at the outcome , given agbonlahor 's importance to the team and the absences of ashley westwood , nathan baker , philippe senderos and kieran richardson .
` it is great for us , ' lambert said .
' i said at the time i did n't think it was a red card and everyone 's assumption was the same .
ex-referees have come out and said it was n't .
` so your own common sense told you it was n't a red card .
gabby is playing really well at the minute so we hoped it would be rescinded .
` we are still without a few - westy , nathan , senderos and richardson - so we did n't want another one out .
not one of your big players .
