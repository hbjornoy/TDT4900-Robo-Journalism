sergio aguero has been turning up the heat off the pitch ahead of the new season as his manchester city side look to retain the premier league title .
the 26-year-old was pictured with the club 's chef on thursday with the food on display looking as good as the argentine 's goal record since joining the club three years ago .
aguero has proved to be a huge asset to city in that time scoring a number of crucial goals , none more so than the one against queens park rangers which secured them their first title in 44 years .
impressive : sergio aguero and the club chef admire the final product on show .
lethal : despite injury problems last term aguero scored 28 goals in 34 games .
highly-rated : aguero has proved to be a big hit on the club and international scene .
despite this aguero has endured his fair share of injuries too , missing key games in both the 2012/13 and 2013/14 season , although in the case of the latter it made minimal difference as city won their second title in just three years .
city are hopeful of tying up aguero to a long-term contract at the club sooner rather than later after making it clear the 26-year-old is pivotal to their future plans .
