winston bogarde has claimed that chelsea never asked him to take a pay cut on his # 40,000-a-week salary and the club also would n't send him out on loan for anything less than 100 per cent of his wages being paid during his ill-fated spell at stamford bridge .
the dutch defender joined chelsea in 2000 but rarely featured for the first team during his four-year spell in west london .
bogarde was signed when gianluca vialli was chelsea boss , but the italian was sacked within a week to be replaced by claudio ranieri .
winston bogarde spent four years at stamford bridge but hardly featured in chelsea 's first team .
despite his lack of playing opportunities , bogarde honoured the contract and continued to collect his # 40k salary from the club .
but , in an interview with the guardian , the 44-year-old said he was never asked to take a pay cut and chelsea would n't loan him to another club unless they paid all of his wages .
` no , they did n't try that , ' bogarde replied when asked whether chelsea considered cutting his wages .
he added : ` vialli bought me and when i had been there a week he got sacked .
you have to look who the new manager 's going to be and if you 're still going to get a chance .
bogarde was signed under gianluca vialli , who was replaced by claudio ranieri -lrb- right -rrb- within a week .
` they had to cut costs .
my situation was not very good and we tried to solve it many ways .
like to maybe go on loan or sell me , or whatever .
but in the end it did n't work out .
' a club could not pay my whole salary -lrb- for a loan deal -rrb- , they could maybe pay 70 per cent .
and they asked chelsea to pay the other 30 per cent and chelsea said : `` no .
if you want to take him it 's going to be 100 % or nothing .
he is going nowhere '' .
' ` of course .
for a player , for me , it 's terrible not to play .
yet i had to return for training .
return looking for the next solution
