a dementia-suffering pensioner was sent home from hospital with a tube still in her arm , barefoot and naked except for an open-backed nhs gown .

the mother of seven was discharged on saturday , and was sent home in an ambulance because her daughter , joy stafford , with whom she lives , was at work .
blunder : lily winfield pictured after she was .
discharged wearing only a hospital gown -lrb- left -rrb- and with a tube still in .
her arm -lrb- right -rrb- .
but when her mother arrived home joy - herself a carer - was horrified to find a cannula , which was used for an intravenous drip , was still in her arm .
and despite the winter cold mrs winfield , who has vascular dementia and diabetes , was wearing just a hospital gown with her clean and pressed nightclothes still unworn in her suitcase .
ms stafford said the blundering hospital staff were forced to send a rapid response team to quickly and safely remove the cannula still in her mother 's arm before it became infected .
the hospital has since apologised to ms stafford and mrs winfield and has said an investigation has been launched .
disgusted : joy stafford and her mother , lily winfield , 77 .
ms stafford is now launching a complaint about her mother 's care .
ms stafford said : ` it 's disgusting .
` i 'm a carer myself and i always think ` what if that was me in that bed or chair ?
how would i want to be treated ?
' ` you think they are in the best place for them , in the hospital , and this makes me not want to send her there any more .
` she must 've been freezing .
i took her straight upstairs and washed her .
i took a photo of the cannula and what she looked like - it was just shocking .
' now joy , 43 , said she is considering making a formal complaint .
