the plans include 1.14 million square feet of residential space which will be turned into 1,400 apartments , including 280 affordable units .
there will also be space for shops with 300,000 square feet of retail space .
corporate housing will account for 175.000 square feet .
the high rise 's entrance into the skyline must first be approved by the community board , which may very well veto the project since they want to keep the neighborhood small .
however , the board may be more inclined to approve the somewhat generic looking skyscraper since it looks more traditional compared to earlier designs .
previous renderings for the site showed an avant-garde set of towers connected at the top .
if approved , construction is slated to start in 2017 and wrap up sometime in 2020 .
in the clouds : if completed , the skyscraper will be one of the tallest in the new york city skyline - reaching above the landmark chrysler building .
