celtic risk being haunted by ` disgrace ' and ` shame ' if they fail to beat one of the weakest rangers teams in old firm history , according to former ibrox regular bert konterman .
the dutchman , scorer of a treble-wrecking league cup semi-final winner against celtic back in 2002 , is under no illusions about who should win sunday 's hampden clash .
but he believes that the pressure of trying to avoid humiliation -- and virulent abuse from their own fans -- could work against ronny deila 's men , declaring : ` if celtic lose on sunday it 's a disgrace for them .

konterman strikes to score the winner against celtic in a treble-wrecking league cup semi-final in 2002 .
` they would be slaughtered for half a year by all the fans .
it would last until they win the league and get going in the champions league qualifiers again .
` celtic is stronger than rangers because they play in a higher league and have more money .
they have to win -- they have to .
if they do n't , it will be a shame on them .
` if you are making a prediction then you 'd put all your money on celtic .
celtic are the biggest club , they have the money so rangers are the underdogs .
in some ways that makes it easier for them , they can just focus on playing their game .
` the rangers fans want to see their team win , of course , but they also just want to see a team playing a committed as they can be .
if they do that , they ' ll get a standing ovation from the fans .
` it 's a chance for rangers to test themselves against old rivals , but there is no pressure because everyone expects celtic to win .
' konterman -lrb- second right -rrb- believes that celtic would be a disgrace if they lost to rangers on sunday .
the pressure will be on ronny deila -lrb- pictured -rrb- , konterman thinks , because celtic are fully expected to win .
