james wignall , 16 , was left ` staggered ' after police called at his home to speak with him about his skipping ` frightening ' his neighbour 's horses .
a teenage boxing champion has been visited by police following claims he was scaring horses by skipping in the street .
james wignall said he was left ` staggered ' after officers accused him of frightening his neighbour 's horses as he trained in the country lane outside his home in croston , near chorley , lancashire .
the 16-year-old , who has won 14 of his 17 fights so far including a north west title , said : ' i thought it was a joke at first .
two officers came out - just for that .
' the visit came on a saturday evening - the busiest night of the week for lancashire 's police force .
and it came just months after the constabulary confessed they were they were no longer attending certain categories of crime including ` routine ' burglaries .
personal visits have now been replaced with telephone calls .
james , who is back in full training after taking time out of the ring for his gcses , regularly spends up to 45 minutes exercising with the rope outside his front door .
his mother carol said : ` it is crazy .
surely the police have much better things to be doing on a saturday night than chasing up a complaint like this .
' i could n't believe it when i opened the door and they were standing there .
it is not as if he is breaking the law .
' james , whose last fight was a victory over tyson fury 's cousin walter , took to the street with his skipping rope because his garden is not big enough .
he said : ` you need a hard surface - grass is no good .
but i 've been in the road skipping for years .
it is not as if i just started .
` the horses were in a field opposite , behind a huge hedge .
i was n't aware i was spooking them .
there are tractors thundering down this lane and they do n't seem scared of those .
` i 'm not making a lot
