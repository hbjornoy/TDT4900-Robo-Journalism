a new advertisement campaign telling men to ` man up , put on an apron ' in order to ` give mums a night off ' is under fire for pushing an outdated and sexist message .
the intention behind new zealand pork 's television and facebook ads appear to have been to send up sexism , stating : ` there are more women in new zealand 's workforce today than ever before but men are still not putting on an apron and doing their share of cooking ' .
however it clearly backfired , with social media users taking to twitter and facebook to criticise the campaign , dubbing it ` sexist ' and an 'em barrassment ' .

an advertisement campaign by new zealand pork has been dubbed ` sexist ' by social media users .
one of the instruction for a pork belly recipe states : ` throw it in a 170 degree oven and watch a grand slam final of women 's tennis -lrb- roughly 30 minutes -rrb- ' ` we reckon it 's time more women got out of the kitchen , and more men started to man them .
but we know it ai n't easy .
so we 've developed the world 's first cooking website designed just for blokes .
with a little encouragement , we might be able to get yours to man up and put an apron on before you know it , ' the website states .
recipe names include the likes of ` your big pork balls ' , with a glossary definition for the words ` recipe book ' being ` the thing your wife stands on to reach things ' .
one of the instruction for a pork belly recipe states : ` throw it in a 170 degree oven and watch a grand slam final of women 's tennis -lrb- roughly 30 minutes -rrb- ' while the other instructions measure time in how long it takes to drink a beer - 15 minutes , according to the ad .
it also features a difficulty metre for recipes , with ` super easy ' represented by ` like burping after a beer ' , and ` challenging ' represented by ` like remembering your missus birthday ' .
