a neighbourly row over a 3ft garden fence has spilled over into the courts because a woman painted her side of a fence white .
lyndsey gagrica , 34 , has been charged with criminal damage after her neighbours of 13 years reported her to police over the dispute .
sue and david ward , both 59 , paid # 80 for a fence to sit on top of a low wall in the front garden of their semi-detached home in carlton , nottingham , and spent a further # 172 on council planning application fees .
lyndsey gagrica has been charged with criminal damage after painting her neighbour 's fence white on the side facing her home in carlton , nottingham .
the 3ft fence was erected on top of the low wall dividing the front gardens of the semi-detached houses .
mrs gagrica 's neighbours david ward , pictured , and his wife sue , reported her to police for the paint job .
but the couple , who have lived in their home for 25 years , were incensed when mrs gagrica , a beautician , painted the side facing her house bright white in february .
the latest in a string of arguments between the neighbours was ` the straw that broke the camel 's back ' , according to mrs ward , and they called the police .
mrs gagrica , who lives with her husband and daughter , was ordered to attend carlton police station last month and has since been charged .
she will appear in front of nottingham magistrates this month .
mrs gagrica said : ` they would n't be able to see anything on my side .
i do n't understand how it could be criminal damage .
' i was made to feel like a criminal for doing nothing more than picking up a tin and a brush .
' i even got some advice from homebase as to what the best type of paint would be .
' i think it 's diabolical that they think i should n't have any say in what my side of the fence looks like .
' mrs ward said the fence was put up
