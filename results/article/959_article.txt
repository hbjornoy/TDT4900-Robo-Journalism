the man who partnered queen 's composer sir peter maxwell davies for 11 years before they broke up said yesterday he is now living with a woman .
the mail on sunday revealed last week how sir peter had gone to court in an attempt to evict colin parkinson from the converted barn they once shared on the orkney island of sanday , in a dispute involving allegations of domestic abuse .
mr parkinson , 57 , said he was ` devastated ' by the split from sir peter , 78 , who has been the master of the queen 's music since 2004 .
sir peter , pictured , is attempting to evict colin parkinson from the converted barn they shared on the orkney island of sanday .
but it would appear the legal action has been prompted by mr parkinson , a previously married father of two , allowing a female friend to move in with him at the barn following the break-up .
he said : ` i 've been finding it hard to cope and she 's been a big help .
she 's just a friend .
we 're not cohabiting or anything .
we take turns to sleep on the couch and the bed separately .
' sir peter wants mr parkinson to leave within three weeks and the case returns to kirkwall sheriff court this week .
mr parkinson , who insisted he ` never laid a hand ' on sir peter , said : ` i 'm not going anywhere .
' happier times : sir peter maxwell-davies , left , and his ex-partner colin parkinson before the split .
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .
