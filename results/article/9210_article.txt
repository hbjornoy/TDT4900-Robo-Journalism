the owners of a christmas attraction were left scratching their heads after one of their reindeers shed her antlers hours before visitors were due to arrive .
blitzen the reindeer was settled into her new temporary christmas quarters on sunday night ahead of the grand opening of a seasonal festival .
but as she was about to welcome families the following morning , her owner opened the doors to her closure and found the animal was missing her trademark antlers .
blitzen the reindeer shocked owners of old holly farm in garstang , lancashire by shedding her antlers the day before visitors were due to arrive .
the animals shed their antlers annually , usually in the spring , and owners of the farm did not expect the phenomenon to happen before christmas .
ian pye , who works at old holly farm in garstang , lancashire , said : ` we 've had so many visitors since we opened on monday and people are really shocked to see a reindeer without antlers .
' i think a lot of people do n't realise that reindeers shed their antlers so they all seem amazed .
` we 've assured the children that it wo n't stop her flying on christmas eve so they do n't seem to mind .
` normally , reindeers shed their antlers in early spring so it 's really unusual to see it this early .
i wonder whether it 's because the weather has been really mild and she 's got a bit confused .
' the antlers have now been attached to the fencing posts outside the deers ' enclosure , alongside a note explaining how reindeer regrow their antlers each year .
but keeper ian pye say that blitzen - even without her trademark antlers - is still popular with visitors .
