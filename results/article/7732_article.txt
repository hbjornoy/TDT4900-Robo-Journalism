an orchestra stuck on board a delayed plane decided to pass the time with an impromptu performance - much to the delight of their fellow passengers .
members of the philadelphia orchestra found themselves stuck on the tarmac for three hours while they waited for their flight from beijing to macau .
so four of them decided to treat their fellow-passengers to a movement from a string quartet by dvorak .
scroll down for video .
no strings attached : the quartet offered fellow-passengers ' a musical surprise ' to raise their spirits after they had been stuck for hours on the tarmac .
in an announcement to the rest of the passengers on a plane , a spokeswoman for the orchestra said : ` the philadelphia orchestra is on tour in china and on the way to macau and our musicians would like to offer you a musical surprise .
' the four then gave a rendition of the finale of dvorak 's american quartet as their audience stood up and filmed them on phones and tablets .
despite the cramped conditions , and half way through , one passenger 's phone ringing , the four raced through the movement 's energetic phrases flawlessly .
first class entertainment : the four played to a sea of mobile phones , one of which went off midway through the performance .
fellow-passengers held the music for them in the absence of music stands .
at one point the cameraman rotated the device the four were being filmed on , and the picture did not auto correct .
at the of the performance the captive audience responded with cheers and rapturous applause .
now watch the video .
