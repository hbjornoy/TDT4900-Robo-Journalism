shocked !
kevin and breanna fleischman , pictured with their first son maverick , had no idea they were delivered by the same doctor in orange county , los angeles , that they picked to deliver their first-born .
rare : dr barrie may of saddleback medical center has delivered more than 10,000 babies but this is a first .
the couple did n't meet until high school , and married nine years later .
despite growing up a mile apart , they were n't quite aware how closely-entangled their lives were .
breanna , 28 , told ktla 5 : ' i told my mother-in-law , we 've got dr may and she said `` oh he delivered kevin as well !
'' that 's a little crazy .
' it was also a career first for dr may , who has worked for 46 years but never delivered a mom , dad , and son .
history in action : dr may pictured -lrb- left -rrb- in 1986 with newborn breanna and -lrb- right -rrb- with newborn kevin in 1984 .
career first : the couple said dr may was incredibly supportive throughout the pregnancy and the birth .
` it 's literally a full circle , ' dr may told ktla 5 .
` kevin told me , `` oh by the way you delivered my wife .
'' i 've had that happen a number of times .
` but then , `` oh by the way you delivered me too .
'' and that was a first .
' and kevin , 30 , said they are already thinking of a second .
` as long as he 's sticking around and practising then you know , maybe it 'll be 11,000 + by then .
we 'll see .
