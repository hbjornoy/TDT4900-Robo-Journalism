' astonishing answer : father-of-one david bridgman said he was given the astonishing instruction to take the bin on the bus when he phoned canterbury city council to find out why binmen had n't taken away his household rubbish .
red-faced council bosses have since apologised to mr bridgman after admitting the comment was ` inappropriate ' .
the 25-year-old , who lives with his pregnant girlfriend hannah , 24 , and their 22-month-old son harley in herne bay , kent , said : ` when i saw our wheelie bin had n't been emptied i phoned the council to ask why and was told it was because our bin was too heavy and would break the dust cart .
' i said to the woman , well what do you suggest i do with the rubbish if they wo n't take it away and she told me the only thing i could do was take it myself to the local tip .
` my nearest tip is a mile-and-a-half away .
i do n't have a car , so i said to her the only way i could possibly get there was to get on the bus .
` she replied : ` well , if needs must , you will have to get a bus .
' unhappy customer : mr bridgman lives a nearly two miles from the dump and ca n't drive so he was shocked when the suggestion to take the bin on the bus was made .
' i just laughed at her .
no bus driver would let me on their bus with a wheelie bin .
and if the wheelie bin was too heavy
