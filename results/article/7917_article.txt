luis suarez claims to be loving life at liverpool and has no thoughts of leaving anfield .
the uruguay star has enjoyed a superb season for the reds , scoring 31 goals and winning both the professional footballers ' association and football writers ' player of the year awards .
that came after a hugely controversial summer last year , when suarez - serving a ban after biting chelsea 's branislav ivanovic - tried to force a move away .
superstar : luis suarez has no intention of leaving liverpool this summer after a fine season .
talk of exit : the striker is reportedly interesting la liga giants real madrid and barcelona .
now transfer speculation has started again but suarez , who earlier this week denied a clause allowing him to move to one of europe 's biggest clubs had been inserted into a contract signed in december , has been quick to distance himself from the rumours .
the 27-year-old , who is reportedly of interest to real madrid , told sky sports news : ' i signed the contract because i love it here and i 'm so happy here .
if you 're not happy here you do n't sign any contract .
` liverpool 's team for me is one of the best in the world because nobody here in the dressing room thinks i am better than another and the people here inside melwood work very well .
' i love it here and this mentality i like because maybe in some other dressing rooms i am bigger than you and another bigger , it 's difficult for the team-mates to play together on the pitch in something like that .
' happy : suarez only signed his new contract earlier this season and says he loves the club .
rewarded : the uruguayan won the pfa player of the year , with eden hazard winning young player of the year .
