chris brunt is keen to turn windsor park into a fortress to help northern ireland qualify for euro 2016 .
` we have started this campaign well with two away wins , but the home win over the faroes was also an important result .
` to build on that would be great .
` in the last few years , those games were the ones that have tended to let us down .
hopefully we can take that on and carry it on in our remaining four home games and we 'll have a great chance of qualifying .
