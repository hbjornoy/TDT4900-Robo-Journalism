with courses on david beckham , harry potter and politicising beyonc√© on offer at prestigious universities , it comes as no surprise that students are now able to learn the art of the perfect ` selfie ' .
budding photographers will be taught valuable life skills to prepare them to face an expectant world which could present a photo opportunity at any point as part of a new city lit course in london .
