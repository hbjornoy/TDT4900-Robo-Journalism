nikki allan , from sunderland , who was brutally stabbed and beaten to death in 1992 .
over 20 years later northumbria police are in talks with the bbc 's crimewatch with a view to filming a reconstruction of nikki 's final hours .
a crimewatch appeal could help finally snare the savage killer of a little girl who was stabbed and beaten to death more than 20 years ago .
schoolgirl nikki allan was just seven years old when she was brutally murdered just yards from her home in sunderland .
she was stabbed 37 times and her head was beaten with a brick before her body was dumped in a derelict warehouse .
no one was ever convicted of the 1992 killing and nikki 's brutal murder remains unsolved to this day .
but now northumbria police are in talks with the bbc 's crimewatch with a view to filming a reconstruction of nikki 's final hours .
the schoolgirl 's mother sharon henderson , 48 , is hoping a fresh appeal could finally bring an end to her two decades of heartache .
ms henderson , of ryhope , sunderland , is reported to have said : ' i want to see the killer behind bars .
` the police wo n't tell me if they have something new but a crimewatch reconstruction could help me get justice .
' i have never given up hope that justice will be done .
i have fought for so long and i know nikki would be proud of me .
' ms henderson , who has three other daughters now in their 20s , added : ' i only hope something comes from a reconstruction .
' george heron , then 24 , of wear garth , hendon , sunderland , was sharon 's neighbour at the time of the killing and was charged with nikki 's murder .
however , a confession he made to police was ruled inadmissible as evidence by a judge at the trial and heron was cleared of the charge .
he was subsequently ordered to pay # 7,000 in damages , money he still owes , after ms henderson successfully sued him through the civil courts
