police in paris discovered two boys living in squalid conditions in an unlit cellar while the rest of their family lived in comparative luxury upstairs , it emerged today .
the boys , named as damien , 12 , and hugo , 10 , by authorities , had been forced to sleep on bare mattresses surrounded by their own filth for the past three years while their father , 39 , step-mother , 44 , and her seven-year-old son lived upstairs .
they were allowed out to attend the local state school in the day , but at night were locked into the cellar which had no natural light , electricity or toilet , and was never cleaned .
they were often beaten with a belt by their father , it is alleged , and forced to go without food .
french television news says this is the house in the quiet suburb of seine-saint-denis where the family lived .
the shocking conditions the children lived in became apparent last wednesday night when the older boy , damien , escaped and ran to the local police station in bondy , seine-saint-denis , to the north-east of paris .
he told officers about the conditions he and his brother lived in , and officers went to their house in the suburb to see for themselves .
deve maboungou , of unsa police , said : ` when the police arrived they found a mattress and excrement - it was just as the boy had said .
' officers found the boys had ` scratches and burst blood vessels on their arms ' , according to nord eclair .
the source added : ` they slept on mattresses on the floor , without sheets , in the middle of their own mess ' in the cellar which was ` in an advanced state of decay ' .
a source said the boys ' mistreatment began when their drug-addict mother moved out and their father moved in with another woman who had two sons , now aged seven and 17 .
the older boy is said to be a ` petit rat ' student dancer at the opera de paris , which is looking after him
