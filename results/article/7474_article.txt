alan shearer has told wayne rooney it 's about time he delivered at a world cup -- but has backed the striker to go on and break sir bobby charlton 's long-standing england goals record .
on the grandest stage , rooney is yet to score .
he was an injured imitation of himself at the 2006 competition , which ended with a red card against portugal in the quarter-finals .
in 2010 he criticised his own supporters on camera after the dourest of draws against algeria .
` he probably has n't yet gone to a world cup in the best of fitness and you ca n't argue with his record at international level overall , ' shearer said .
scroll down for videos ... it 's time !
wayne rooney needs to perform at a world cup , says former england striker alan shearer .
` he 's got 38 goals for england -- 11 short of bobby charlton 's record , and i think he will go on to break it .
` but he needs to have a big tournament with england and , if he does that , he will be the key to us having a successful world cup .
listen , i 'm a fan of rooney .
i think he ticks all the boxes as a player .
hot shot : shearer , pictured scoring at world cup ' 98 , believes rooney will break england 's goal scoring record .
` but for him to be put in the same bracket as lionel messi or cristiano ronaldo , he needs to have a great tournament in brazil .
` although having said that , messi has yet to set the place on fire at a world cup too .
' alan shearer will be a bbc pundit during the world cup in brazil .
