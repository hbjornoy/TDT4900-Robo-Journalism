an ` energetic and sporty ' 23-year-old has died hours after getting a tattoo .
federica iammatteo , a student from milan , was said to be ` in perfect health ' , before getting a new design inked onto her body .
but the next morning she went into septic shock , haemorrhaging .
that night her heart stopped and she died .
ms iammatteo had visited a specialist tattoo parlour on thursday afternoon to get the new drawing - to the right of her spine .
she already had other tattoos in the centre of her back .
but by friday morning she felt shivery and had pins and needles in her hands and feet .
she texted a friend saying she thought she had a fever .
her symptoms rapidly got worse prompting her family to seek medical help .
she was seen by doctors at the san giuseppe hospital in milan , but as soon as she arrived she began to haemorrhage and was immediately transferred to the policlinica , milan 's top hospital .
medical staff advised her family to go home and that they would call if there was any change for the worse .
her father agostino iammatteo told corriere della sera : ` as soon as we got to hospital she was put on a tube and the doctors did not hide the seriousness of the situation .
` we wanted to stay near but the doctor said there was no need , that they would call us if she got worse .
' then on saturday morning at 3am they were called by staff who told them she had died .
now her devastated family are seeking answers .
mr iammatteo said : ` you do n't die like this at 23 years old .
she was full of energy , sporty .
we want to know what happened .
