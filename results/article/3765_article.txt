it may look rather more like a toy car than a hi-tech racing machine , but this mini-racer has become the world 's fastest electric car .
called the grimsel , and developed by swiss researchers , it broke the previous world record for acceleration by going from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres .
the carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp -lrb- 147 kw -rrb- .

the mini-motor went from from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres .
total weight of only 168kg .
powered by four amz m4 wheel hub motors .
produce 37kw each at a weight of 3.4 kg .
the planetary gearbox which is integrated into the upright transmits the torque to accumulated 1630nm at the wheels .
the chassis is a one piece carbon fibre monocoque .
aerodynamics package produces enough downforce to drive at the ceiling at 110km/h .
raced by the the formula student team at the academic motorsports club zurich -lrb- amz -rrb- , it beat the previous record of 2.134 seconds , which was held by an electric car built by delft university of technology .
the new record was set at the military airfield in dübendorf , where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres .
the new record-breaking vehicle is a formula student electric car that was developed and built in less than a year by 30 students at eth zurich and lucerne university of applied sciences and arts .
the ` grimsel ' is the fifth amz electric car and the result of continuous development .
the carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp -lrb- 147 kw -rrb- .
a four-wheel drive is implemented with four specially designed wheel hub motors , which generate a total torque of 1630 nm at the wheels .
by means of traction control , torque distribution is controlled individually for each wheel to maximise vehicle acceleration .
no other production vehicle in the world has reached a similarly strong acceleration .
the new record was set at the military airfield in dübendorf , where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres .
