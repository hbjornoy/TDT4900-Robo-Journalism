working in construction , the aptly named richard mason was used to digging up all sorts .
so when he found a grubby old jug while underpinning a house on the island of lindisfarne , he just threw it in the back of his van without a second thought .
it was eight years later when he stumbled across it again in his father 's basement where he 'd left it and decided to clean it .
rare : the collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s , pictured with a 15th century german bartmann jug .
chance find : richard mason -lrb- right -rrb- with the jug and his father tom -lrb- left -rrb- .
when he tipped it up , to his amazement out fell a pile of gold and silver coins - including one stamped with pope clement vii , who famously refused to annul the marriage of henry viii to catherine of aragon in the 1520s .
the coin , called a scudo , comes from ancona in central italy and is believed to be possibly only the second of its kind discovered anywhere in the world .
it is so rare that experts mr mason contacted in italy are only aware of one other coin like it having been sold in the last two decades .
together , the collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s could be worth tens of thousands in total , but the rarity of the scudo means putting an exact price on them has so far been impossible .
geographical spread : the coins are from italy , saxony and france .
the coins found are said to come from across europe and date back to the 16th century.one of them is said to be a gold scudo , a coin made in italy in the 1500s .
the scudo originates from ancona , in central italy , and is stamped with the sign of pope clement vii , who famously refused to annul the marriage of henry viii to catherine of aragon in 1527 .
it is believed to be the first coin of its type discovered anywhere
