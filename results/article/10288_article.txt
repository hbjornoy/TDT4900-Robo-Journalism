a mother .
whose back garden once contained the bodies of a murdered couple has .
spoken of her profound shock at the discovery of their remains , saying .
that she ` went to pieces ' .
sue .
bramley and her 15-year-old daughter live at a property in mansfield .
where susan and christopher edwards shot and killed william and patricia .
wycherley -- susan 's parents -- in 1998 and buried the bodies under the .
lawn .
they remained a macabre secret until 2013 , with ms bramley a resident since 2006 .
ms bramley described how she was horrified when nottinghamshire detectives phoned her at work in october last year and told her about their grim discovery - of remains buried three feet beneath her lawn .
she said : ` it was terrible .
i went to pieces .
i came home and all these people arrived in white suits .
i 've lost track of what happened , i was so emotional .
' but although the unearthing of the remains proved a huge shock to ms bramley , she insists she 'll be perfectly happy to stay at the house .
she told the bbc : ` a lot of people have said , `` how can you possibly still live there ?
''' ` but i love our home .
we have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times here .
` i have lived here all this time and the wycherleys have not done me any harm .
they are not going to do my any harm now .
i am going to stay .
' ms bramley said she ` never really thought anything ' of the area in her garden where grass would not grow , where it would later emerge the wycherleys had been buried .
` we used to have birthday parties in the garden , which my young nieces and nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area .
my nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and i just think , `` how close , how close '' .
