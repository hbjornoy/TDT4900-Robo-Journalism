eleven-year-old lucy li took her bow at the us women 's open at pinehurst on thursday , resplendent in a stars-and-stripes outfit .
and the californian junior , the youngest to play in a us open -- men 's or women 's -- could hardly have got off to a better start , bagging birdies at the first and fifth holes .
sadly , li could not continue the fairytale and eventually slid to an eight-over-par 78 that left her some way off the first-round lead .

out with the driver : the 11-year-old is the youngest ever qualifier for the tournament at pinehurst .
but she performed a whole lot better than american backmarker xyra suyetsugu , who carded an 88 -- and she is 27 .
meanwhile , rory mcilroy endured a torrid time with his wedge and putter at the irish open , recording a three-over par 74 that left him 10 shots behind first-round pacesetter mikko ilonen of finland .
` i was very sloppy with the scoring clubs today , ' admitted mcilroy , who revealed he had received a ` great reaction ' to his decision to play for ireland at the 2016 olympics in rio .
` i drove the ball beautifully again , putting myself in great positions , but i was not able to capitalise .
hopefully i 'll do a better job tomorrow .
' rough patch : she was seven over-par after 16 holes , caught with a tricky shot on the 11th hole .
