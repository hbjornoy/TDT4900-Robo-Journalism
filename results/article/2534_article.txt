this is the hilarious moment a squirrel was spotted wearing a plastic horse head .
looking for a tasty peanut , the squirrel buried its face into a feeder in the shape of a horse 's head .
but the animal did not know that he was being caught on camera by florida photographer jim zielinski , 43 , who had posed up the shot in his back garden .
the pictures were taken by florida photographer jim zielinski who planned to take the perfect picture by suspending the feeder from a string and hiding a peanut inside .
this is the hilarious moment a squirrel tucked his head into a feeder - shaped like a horse 's head to munch on a peanut hidden inside it .
mr zielinski , from florida , went to great lengths to capture the perfect shot by making holes in the horse head feeder before suspending it from the branches of a tree in his back garden in the sunshine state .
but what started out as a fun project has now become an internet sensation with jim 's pictures racking up over 1.5 million views online .
he said : ` as soon as i saw the feeder online i knew i had get some photos , i started setting it up pretty much immediately after it arrived .
` we currently have about seven squirrels living near our house , i knew it would n't be long before one arrived because there are usually a few waiting for us to come out and toss a few peanuts .
` the branch i tied it to was right above where we feed the squirrels by hand so they are used to eating there .
' mr zielinski quickly thought of how he could suspend the feeder from a branch and capture the hilarious scene .
he said : ' i decided to put a hole in the back of the horse head and tie another line to hold it straight , by doing that i managed to suspend it in the air .
the feeder looks up towards the horse 's head which he knows has a tasty peanut hidden inside .
