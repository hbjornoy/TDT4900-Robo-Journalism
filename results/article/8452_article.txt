wall street veteran robert fagenson -lrb- left -rrb- won $ 65,000 on the new york state lotto last week , after some two decades playing twice a week with a specific set of numbers .
' i was just wondering if the system really worked , ' fagenson told the post .
` now i know it actually works .
' while fagenson spent an estimated $ 5,800 on the lottery in the 20 years he has been playing , it does seem to have been a worthy investment - so he plans to continue .
in the end , $ 65,000 likely does n't make much of a dent on fagenson 's overall fortune , since it 's approximately the amount he donated to a long island-based animal charity in 2011 , according to the wall street journal .
the native new yorker graduated from syracuse university in 1970 with a degree in transportation sciences & finance .
he went on to spend most of his career on the new york stock exchange , where he was once governor of the trading floor and served on the board of directors .
he is currently the ceo of fagenson and co , a 50-year-old brokerage that works in investment brokerage and money management as well .
according to public records , he owns an apartment on the upper east side of manhattan worth approximately $ 2.8 million according to zillow .
