any working mother will tell you that trying to raise children while also holding down a busy job is extremely tiring and very hard work .
so , spare a thought for super mum amanda owen , who not only tends to a flock of 1000 sheep every day on a sprawling , remote farm , but also balances that with raising her brood of seven children .
the 39-year-old shepherdess runs a 2,000-acre sheep farm from a village in the beautiful yorkshire dales .

amanda juggles looking after 1,000 sheep with bringing up seven children .
amanda , who was born in industrial huddersfield , moved to the remote farm 20-years ago with clive after being inspired by james herriot books .
amanda rides her quad bike as she heads out to feed her sheep .
the mother-of-seven rides her horse on to the moors to feed the other horses at her farm .
amanda usually takes her children out to the fields with her everyday while working on her farm .
she shares the ancient house on the farm with husband clive and their seven children ; raven , 13 , reuben , ten , miles , .
seven , edith , seven , violet , sidney and baby annas .
and the family are so far away from shops and services that all but two of her children were born en route to the hospital because it is a two hour drive over treacherous roads .
her children rarely visit shops or cinemas and muck in with the work at ravenseat farm in the village of keld , north yorkshire , as soon as they 're old enough to walk .
she takes her three youngest children annas , sidney and violet out into the fields with her every day .
amanda said : ` life is extremely busy , and it is just a case of fitting everything in .
' i not only have all my kids to feed , but also all of the sheep as well .
