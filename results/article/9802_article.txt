tottenham are ready to join sunderland in the race for valencia midfielder ever banega .
black cats boss gus poyet looks to be pole position to land the argentina man ahead of next season .
but new spurs boss mauricio pochettino , a compatriot of banega , is also a fan and is keen to explore a move for the 25-year-old .
wanted man : ever banega -lrb- left -rrb- , pictured here training with argentina , is a target for tottenham and sunderland .
out of favour : banega -lrb- left -rrb- was sent out on loan last season and could be available for just # 5.5 million .
new man : spurs boss mauricio pochettino is keen on bringing his compatriot banega to white hart lane .
banega was left out of argentina 's world cup squad and will now concentrate on securing his next move .
he was sent out on loan to newell 's old boys last season and is likely to be available for around # 5.5 million this summer .
pochettino has prioritised a new left-back and central-defender this summer .
swansea 's ben davies os an option at left-back , while southampton centre-back dejan lovren could follow pochettino to white hart lane .
target : tottenham are also interested in a summer move for swansea left-back ben davies -lrb- right -rrb- .
on the move ?
pochettino would like to be reunited with southampton defender dejan lovren -lrb- right -rrb- at white hart lane .
