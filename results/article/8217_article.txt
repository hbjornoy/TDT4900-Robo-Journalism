it 's not just a fourth stand they are building at bristol city .
sadly for steve cotterill , though , they will have to wait a while longer to underline their progress by taking the scalp of a big team .
for large swathes of this match , it looked possible .
west ham were often desperately poor and bristol city were frequently exciting .
they attacked with pace and without fear ; they created chances and did everything except take them .
twice matt smith won headers within a dangerous range and twice he beat adrian in west ham 's goal .
twice , there was a man waiting on the line to clear .
that final yard was the hurdle and curse for a club who only have three quarters of a stadium , but dream big and sit second in league one .
