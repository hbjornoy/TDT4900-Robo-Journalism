arise sir wiggo : bradley wiggins , britain 's first tour de france champion , has been given a knighthood in the new year 's honours list .
britain 's olympic heroes have been rewarded for their success with a record number of gongs in the new year honours list .
the athletes , coaches and organisers who brought delight to the nation this summer dominate the list like no other group before them .
a staggering 127 awards have been handed out to those involved -- more than 10 per cent of the total .
the figure is unprecedented in the 122-year history of the list .
among the 78 athletes and coaches honoured were cyclist bradley wiggins and sailor ben ainslie , who both received knighthoods .
sir bradley , as he will be known , made sporting history this year by becoming the first briton to win the tour de france , and followed the feat by scooping an olympic gold , as well as being crowned bbc sports personality of the year .
he heads a sparkling list of sporting heroes , including paralympic cyclist sarah storey , who was made a dame , and jessica ennis , victoria pendleton , mo farah and david weir , who all received cbes .
wiggins , affectionately known as wiggo , said : ` it 's quite something really .
i never imagined that i would ever become a knight , so it 's an incredible honour , but there 's a slight element of disbelief , and it will take a while to sink in .
there was never any doubt whether i 'd accept it or not , it was more a case that i never saw myself as a sir , and i probably never will .
' the honours crown a year of excellence in british sport -- so much so that a special honours list was added to recognise the 65 medals , 29 of them gold , won at this year 's olympic games , as well as the 120 medals -- including 34 golds -- won at the paralympic games .
there was also recognition for those behind the games .
