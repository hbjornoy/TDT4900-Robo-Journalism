an idyllic mediterranean morning and i 'm sitting in a cafe overlooking a harbour full of boats bobbing on the azure water .
but it 's not the boats i 'm watching , nor the gulls gliding and dipping across the cloudless sky : it 's the young couple on the adjacent table .

we look older , a few pounds heavier and sometimes we 're downright grumpy , but i 'd like to think the sparkle is just about still there in our eyes , if you look hard enough .
as hard-up honeymooners we rented a pied-a-terre ; this time around we 've got a huge villa with its own pool .
it may sound as if we 're better off but in truth we 're not , for four very good reasons .
we 've brought along our daughters :
