a mother has to keep her five-year-old daughter locked out of the kitchen at all times - because a rare condition means she could eat herself to death .
ava carvey has prader-willi syndrome -lrb- pws -rrb- which leaves her constantly hungry meaning the family kitchen has to be kept behind bars .
her mother , marika carvey , 35 , has to keep ava on a strict low calorie diet to prevent her overeating .
five-year-old ava carvey -lrb- with mother marika -rrb- has prader-willi syndrome , which means she is constantly hungry .
she was diagnosed when she was nine-weeks-old because doctors noticed she was not moving or feeding properly .
mrs carvey , from bromley , said : ` if ava had access to the food , she would eat whatever she could lay her hands on .
` she 's not just permanently hungry - she 's ravenous .
if there 's food on the floor , she 'll pick it up and eat it , and if someone else has food she wants theirs too .
she 'll even take food away and hide it .
` it 's scary because if we did n't watch her she 'd eat until her she made herself sick .
` when she gets older we will have to put locks on the fridge and cupboards too .
` she 's such a lovely little girl and sometimes i feel so sorry for her - imagine always feeling like you 're starving .
` it must be horrible but she 's always got a smile on her face , she 's always running about enjoying herself just like any other five-year-old .
' ava was diagnosed with the genetic condition at just nine-weeks-old after doctors noticed she was failing to feed and move around properly .
the condition also means her body burns calories very slowly so she is in danger of obesity .
she has to be locked out of the family kitchen to prevent her eating too much .
she gets so hungry that her mother must ensure her other children , joshua , 11 , and finnian , two , never eat in front of her.mrs carvey said
