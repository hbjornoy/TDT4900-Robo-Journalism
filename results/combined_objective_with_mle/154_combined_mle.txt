natalie brown , 32 , and her partner peter gordon , 42 , had been told a rare terminal condition meant their daughter , elsie , would either be stillborn or die shortly after birth .
the couple , who both work as teaching assistants , are waiting for the original terminal diagnosis to be ruled out as they suspect elsie 's condition is in fact a much less serious joint disorder affecting just her legs .
