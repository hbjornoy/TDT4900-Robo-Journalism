the sickening 20 second-long footage , which has gone viral on the internet , appears to show the animal running away from the engine down a stretch of railway track in siberia .
it is unclear what happened to the animal , as no body has been found and no traces of blood were found on the outskirts of norilsk , an industrial city 1,800 miles from moscow .
