alan gross received a chamber-wide standing ovation during tuesday 's state of the union address on tuesday .
the aid worker had spent the past five years languishing in a cuban prison before being freed by president raul castro in a prisoner exchange just before christmas .
gross still looked gaunt and was still minus most of his front teeth as he took pride of place as a guest of first lady michelle obama .
