annual pickering wartime and 1940s weekend is running this weekend , with some of its participants bearing an uncanny resemblance to two of the beloved characters from the classic british comedy - lance-corporal jack jones and commander chuck mainwaring .
the festivities today included an eastern front re-enactment , set in autumn 1942 as the german troops invaded the soviet union .
