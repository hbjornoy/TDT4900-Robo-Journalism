the boys , named as damien , and hugo , 10 , had been forced to sleep on bare mattresses surrounded by their own filth for the past three years while their father , 39 , escaped and ran to the local police station in bondy , seine-saint-denis , to the north-east of paris .
they were allowed out to attend the local state school in the day , but at night were locked into the cellar which had no natural light , electricity or toilet .
