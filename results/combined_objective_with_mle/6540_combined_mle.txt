cambridgeshire constabulary sent out the message from their @cambscops twitter feed saying : ` doing a bit of gardening this weekend ?
make sure your hedges are neatly trimmed , max 1m at the front and 2m at the back ' the tweet , which has since been deleted , was branded ` utterly bizarre ' by followers .
