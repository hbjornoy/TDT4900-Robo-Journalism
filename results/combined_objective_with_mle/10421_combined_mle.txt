first prize went to rogelio moreno , a computer programmer from panama , for capturing a rarely seen image of the open mouth interior and heart-shaped corona of a rotifer .
the amazing image is shot ` head on ' and shows the mouth of the tiny aquatic animal , which is less than 0.004 inches -lrb- 0.1 mm -rrb- long .
