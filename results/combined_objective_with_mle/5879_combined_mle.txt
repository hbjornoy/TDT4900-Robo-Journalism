miguel endara created the image of benjaman kyle , who was found unconscious , bloody and naked behind a burger king dustbin in 2004 in georgia - with no identification or memory of who he was .
the artist wanted to help mr kyle , 64 , who suffered from retrograde amnesia - which is forgetting the past before a major event .
