whitner , a safety for the san francisco 49ers , wants his nike football jersey to read ` hitner ' for his next game - but he 's going to wait , since the shutdown means his name-change wo n't be processed for at least a month .
the nfl fined him $ 21,00 for an illegal hit on a st. louis rams player earlier this season .
whitner will remain a whitner until at least november .
