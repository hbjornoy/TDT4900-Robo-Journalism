iraqi military opened its campaign yesterday to wrest back tikrit , saddam hussein 's hometown , with a multi-pronged assault spearheaded by ground troops backed by tanks and helicopters .
the predominantly sunni city , a hotbed of antipathy toward iraq 's shiite-led government , is one of two major urban centres that fell to insurgents during their lightning offensive earlier this month .
