miami dolphins quarterback ryan tannehill insists he is over the spat with head coach joe philbin and is fully focussed on sunday 's game against the oakland raiders at wembley .
tannehill was unhappy with a lack of support from philbin , who hinted that the quarterback may be benched after miami were beaten 34-15 by the kansas city chiefs last sunday .
