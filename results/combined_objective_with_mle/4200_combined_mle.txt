rio ferdinand is guaranteed to be doing a fair bit of clapping at old trafford this sunday .
he 's not a manchester united player anymore at the theatre of dreams so expect the home fans to show their appreciation and him to return the favour .
rio ferdinand and wayne rooney will be the order of the day as the teams prepare to walk out at the corner of the pitch .
