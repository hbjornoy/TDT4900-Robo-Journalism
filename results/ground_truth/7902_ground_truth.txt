the breakthrough material was created by oxford university scientists .
they used it to switch ` nano-pixels ' on and off to create coloured dots .
each pixel is 300 by 300 nanometres in size - smaller than a human hair .
discovery creates images just a few hundred nanometres across .
this could pave the way for high-resolution , low-energy flexible displays .
it could be used in smart glasses , synthetic retinas , and foldable screens .
