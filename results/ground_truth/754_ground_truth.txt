the # 10 glasses work a little like a periscope , .
using mirrors to bounce light from one place to another so wearer can see in an unnatural direction .
they allow wearers to lie flat on their back without having to strain their neck to see a screen or page in front of them .
similar hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 but never took off .
