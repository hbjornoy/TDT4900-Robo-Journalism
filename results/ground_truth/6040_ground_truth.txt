kerrey , a two-term senator in the '80s and '90s , is disappointed in the president for risking the health of the u.s. economy over obamacare .
` he had to know he was misleading the audience , ' he said of obama 's infamous ` if you like your health care plan ' deception .
explains that an even bigger lie democrats tell is that ` everybody ' can get ` high-quality , affordable health care ' obama , he says , lacks the courage to bring democrats and republicans together to save u.s. entitlement programs from bankruptcy .
