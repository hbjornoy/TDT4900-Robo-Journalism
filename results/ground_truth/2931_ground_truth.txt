healbe gobe wristband was designed by a team of russian developers .
wristband uses an algorithm that analyses data collected by three sensors .
the theory is that when we eat , carbohydrates are turned into glucose .
cells absorb glucose and use it for energy , displacing liquid in the process .
gobe 's sensors track these changes through the skin , and translate it into calorie intake and output .
but doctors have disputed the claims , saying the technology is n't reliable .
