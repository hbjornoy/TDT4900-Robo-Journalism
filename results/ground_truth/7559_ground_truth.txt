photographer steve hinch , 44 , took photos on the snowy plains of yellowstone national park in the united states .
the bushy tailed fox spots a vole and is seen leaping for his prey before diving head first into the frozen surface .
but instead of emerging with a tasty meal in its muzzle , the fox came back empty handed - and a little red faced .
