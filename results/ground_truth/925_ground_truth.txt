a neighbour complained to the council that four-year-old joseph bailey was invading their privacy .
it came after his parents built a play pirate ship for him in their back garden .
but neighbours said joseph could spy on them over the fence .
despite his parents putting up bamboo screen , the ship could be demolished .
to stop that , his parents will have to apply for further planning permission .
