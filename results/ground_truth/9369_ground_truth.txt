two philadelphia families with young children waiting for lung transplants are fighting to change the country 's organ donor laws .
currently public policy states that children under the age of 12 are to be placed at the bottom of the adult donor list , giving them less of a fighting chance to receive a new organ .
the family 's want to change the law so that all children regardless of age are placed on the adult list and organs are awarded by severity of disease .
