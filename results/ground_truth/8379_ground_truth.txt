californian scientists tweaked two genetic pathways in the worm caenorhabditis elegans to amplify its lifespan .
they said the worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years .
research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , and the next step is to investigate if the effects occur in mice .
