victor hawkins , 50 , was stuck in traffic in bradford in december last year .
while waiting at red lights he was photographed in front of a bus stop .
the council issued him with a # 70 fine for breaching the highway code .
however mr hawkins challenged the decision , as stopping is permitted as long as you are prevented from moving by other traffic .
the council has now withdrawn the charge , admitting it was ' a mistake '
