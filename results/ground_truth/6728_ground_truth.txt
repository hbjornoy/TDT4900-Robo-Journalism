snow might normally appear white - but it can also appear red and blue .
in the alps in europe , snow can appear red due to a type of algae .
chlamydomonas nivalis has a pigment that makes it appear red .
but a blue colour can also be caused by light scattering in ice crystals .
in deep snow , more and more light is scattered .
this can give snow a bluish tint , rather the regular white that is seen .
