ann o'sullivan had a large part of her jaw , her left eye and some of her teeth removed after a large tumour was found spreading across her face .
surgeons then used 3d technology to rebuild the left side of her face .
they electronically scanned the other side of her face to build a 3d profile .
they replicated the healthy side using bone from her leg to rebuild her jaw .
she is now having chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
