yelena serova is only the fourth russian women to enter space .
the highly trainer engineer is expected to spend six months on the international space station .

she was also asked if she would be taking make-up into space .
others questioned her decision to leave her daughter , though her fellow male astronauts also have children .
obviously frustrated , yelena eventually asked reporters why they did n't ask her male counterparts about their hair .
