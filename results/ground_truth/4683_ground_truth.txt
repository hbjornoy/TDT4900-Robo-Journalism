scientist from emory 's oxford college , georgia , claims the population explosion began 2,000 years ago - long before other estimates .
the potential for the human population to flourish can be traced to a subtle interaction between competition and organisation , he said .

political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families , and therefore enabled more people to thrive .
the roman empire is an example of a time when this happened .
