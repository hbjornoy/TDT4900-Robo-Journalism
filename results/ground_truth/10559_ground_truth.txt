the mayfair property is based in the historic three kings yard mews which was once the italian embassy chancery .
during the 1930s it was used by italian ambassador and huge supporter of dictator benito mussolini , dino grandi .
he used the mews to arrange parades of the blackshirts to celebrate mussolini 's birthday and italian national days .
the home , two doors down from where the italian ambassador lived , is now one of most expensive two-beds in history after going on sale for # 4.25 m - 25 times its cost in 1985 .
