scientists at nasa in california have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction .
using the hubble space telescope they saw the glow of orphaned stars .
these were once inside galaxies but the structures were ripped apart like ` taffy ' by a galaxy cluster over six billion years .
as many as six galaxies may have been torn apart at the heart of the cluster .
here gravity is strong enough to cause these dramatic effects .
