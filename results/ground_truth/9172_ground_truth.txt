the social network is ` recycling ' likes alongside new , related content that the users may never have seen .
when facebook attaches a user 's ` like ' to the new related post content they do not inform them it has happened .
in some cases users have even seen content and brands ` liked ' on the website by friends who are dead .
facebook spokesman says the feature is part of the sponsored stories ad product and users are able to opt out .
