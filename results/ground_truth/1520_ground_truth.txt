venice 's high tide , or ` acqua alta ' , normally occurs in the winter months .
but this autumn tourists have been caught out by an early seasonal tide .
saint mark 's square was engulfed , tourists were forced to wade barefoot .
high tide put a dampener on holiday makers grabbing a last summer break .
