jennifer cramblett and her wife , amanda zinkon , wanted a white baby and chose a blond , blue-eyed donor from a chicago sperm bank .
when cramblett was five months pregnant , they found out that she had been inseminated by a black man .
cramblett has since filed a lawsuit against the sperm bank , which cites the stress and anxiety of raising a brown girl in a predominantly white ohio town , which she describes as intolerant .
some of her own family members have unconscious racial biases , the lawsuit says .
