jason bulter , 41 , saw the spider while clearing out his shed four weeks ago .
unafraid of creepy crawlies , he let it run past him - but it bit his ankle .
bite went from being a ` gentle sting ' to him having a severely swollen leg .
was told had he waited much longer to seek treatment , he may have needed the leg amputated .
