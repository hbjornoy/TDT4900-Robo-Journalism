scientists from yale university have found evidence for ancient underground life on washington state 's south lopez island .
a mineral called aragonite was found in rocks that are now on the surface .
but 100 million years ago they were 12 miles -lrb- 20km -rrb- underground .
aragonite can form from both biological and physical processes .
however a specific mix of carbon isotopes suggests the aragonite found came from methane made by microorganisms .
the life could have survived in subsurface water between tectonic plates .
discovery would be among the deepest life ever found on earth .
