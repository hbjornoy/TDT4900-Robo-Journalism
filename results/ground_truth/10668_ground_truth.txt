raising beef for the american dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork , poultry , eggs or dairy .
the findings come from a study published monday in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
compared with the other animal proteins , beef produces five times more heat-trapping gases per calorie and puts out six times as much water-polluting nitrogen .
beef also takes 11 times more water for irrigation and uses 28 times the land .
the study did not look at plants or fish raised for human consumption .
