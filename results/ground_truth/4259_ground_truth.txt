britain looking to become founding member of chinese-led regional bank .
but washington has hit out at britain 's ` constant accommodation ' of china .
comments are a rare breach of ` special relationship ' between uk and us .
china first proposed a new asian infrastructure investment bank in 2013 .
it has since pledged to put up most of the bank 's initial $ 50billion in capital .
washington fears it could undercut world bank and international monetary fund .
but britain says joining will help the uk promote commercial ties with asia .
