quartzite tool was made 1.2 million years ago by striking a hard rock .
ancient tool was found west of ismir , on the anatolian peninsula , turkey .

those remains were previously thought to only be 500,000 years old .
anatolian peninsula provided an important gateway from asia into europe .
discovery suggests homo erectus may have entered europe this way .
