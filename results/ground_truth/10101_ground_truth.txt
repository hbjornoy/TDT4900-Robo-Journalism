corbin crawford , 12 , and his little brother dylan , 7 , were walking on the frozen des moines river in iowa on thursday .
they suddenly noticed the ice shifting and decided they could n't move .
rescuers used a rope to send life jackets to the boys .
they then managed to get a light aluminum boat out and pull the pair back into shore .
