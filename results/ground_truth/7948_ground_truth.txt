councillors in east china 's jiangsu province applied to build 20 motorways .
but when planning permission became delayed , they built them anyway .
then they covered with earth and planted soya beans to hide from satellites .
plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted .
it would have meant roads miraculously appeared almost overnight .
but when they refused to compensate local farmers , they reported them .
