senate bill 14 defines ` crimes against nature ' as knowing ` any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth ' consenting adults who perform these sex acts in private and are n't practicing prostitution are excepted from the felony .
the wording therefore makes it illegal for two consenting teens to have oral sex .
senator thomas garrett is sponsoring the bill and says he is drafting an amendment to address complaints about the bill 's ` unintended consequences '
