the humpback was beached in the pool by newport beach , in sydney , australia , while heading to warmer climes .
at 32 feet from tail to snout , this leviathan is the exact same length as a london bus .
it is unclear whether he was abandoned by his pod or simply could n't keep up because of age or injury .
it is now a nervous wait to see if the next high tide will rise enough to reclaim his corpse back to its pacific heartland .
if not , wildlife .
authorities must find a way
