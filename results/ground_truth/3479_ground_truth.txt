david bowers was a store greeter at a meijer in gaylord , michigan .
a customer came into the store last month asking for help with a fire that broke out in his car .
mr bowers grabbed an extinguisher and left his position to help the customer put it out and soon returned to his post .
the store director later fired mr bowers for not following the company 's emergency protocols which dictated he should n't leave his position .
the firing of mr bowers has led meijer regulars to protest the store .
