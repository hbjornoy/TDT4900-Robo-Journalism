the cometary globule , also known as cg4 , is powered by the leftover , dense core of a star .
the head of cg4 , which is the part visible in this eso image , has a diameter of 1.5 light-years .
why cg4 and other cometary globules have their distinct form is still unknown by astronomers .
one theory is cometary globules are shaped by stellar winds and radiation from hot , massive stars .
