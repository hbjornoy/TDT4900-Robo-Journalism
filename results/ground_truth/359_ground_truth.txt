alex hermann was struck by lightning in austin , texas on august 26 .
his heart stopped , his brain was deprived of oxygen and he suffered burns , which required multiple skin grafts after he was raced to hospital .
doctors told his parents they did not know if he would recover .
but he slowly showed astonishing signs of recovery , such as smiling when his favorite song was played .
he can still not walk and struggles to form a full sentence but he has returned home - where he was happily reunited with his dog .
