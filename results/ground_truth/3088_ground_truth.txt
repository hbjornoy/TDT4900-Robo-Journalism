eugene tan -lrb- uge -rrb- has been waking up early every day for the last 15 years to catch the sunrise over bondi beach .
the ritual started purely as a hobby but out of that grew aquabumps , a site which sends a photo out daily .
there is also an aquabumps gallery and the brand has collaborated with some of australia 's biggest companies .
uge has only missed shooting on two mornings , on the days both his sons were born .
