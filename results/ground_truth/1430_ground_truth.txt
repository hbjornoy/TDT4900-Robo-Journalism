lucia sansbury , now one , was born prematurely at just 27 weeks .
doctors had to improvise to keep her warm , so used a sandwich bag .
she had to have surgery to repair her bowel and to save her eyesight .
she seems healthy but it is too soon to say for sure if she has suffered long-term health problems .
