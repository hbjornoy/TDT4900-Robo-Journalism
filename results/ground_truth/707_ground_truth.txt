barberry has ` structural memory ' that helps it anticipate future events .
75 per cent of the time the plant seems to understand that when it has two seeds - one infected and one intact - it 's a much better idea to release both .
when a fruit only bears one seed , and that ends up infested , the barberry aborts only five per cent of the time .
