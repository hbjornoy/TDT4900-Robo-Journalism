chris guerra , 29 , was killed as he crossed the road after photographing justin bieber 's ferrari that had been pulled over in january .
bieber was not in the car ; his friend lil twist was driving and had been stopped for ` speeding ' guerra 's mother said a second vehicle hit her son and that its description - a black range rover or hummer - fits suvs in bieber 's entourage .
