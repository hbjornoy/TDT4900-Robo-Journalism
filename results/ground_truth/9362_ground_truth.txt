there are parallels between ourselves and birds .
reproduction , movements , daily rhythms , communication and intelligence .
birds find their way naturally , while humans have had to discover and invent .
the australian fairy-wrens are all related to each other .
twenty years after their courtship they will be nesting with the same partner .
albatrosses feel love even more intensely than we do .
