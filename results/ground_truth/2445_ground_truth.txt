stephen maxwell murray was convicted of indecent assault in 1991 .
he later worked at a comic book store in melbourne .
he now works at an anime toy store in the city called animasia .
but murray is not breaking any laws because there are no laws that stop convicted paedophiles from working in shops with young customers .
victorian attorney general martin pakula has called for a review of the working with children laws in relation to the sex offenders registration act .
