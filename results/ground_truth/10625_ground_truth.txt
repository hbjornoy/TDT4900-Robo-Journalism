ryan smith was n't wearing a helmet when he was hit by a van last july .
his parents were told he probably would not survive his head injuries .
he was in a coma for four months and spent almost a year in hospital .
he is now in rehabilitation and has taken his first steps in a pool .
his family are ` delighted ' but accept there is still a very long way to go .
they hope his story will encourage other cyclists to wear helmets .
