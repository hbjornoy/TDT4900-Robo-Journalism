a study from the university of new hampshire suggests missions to mars might be impossible due to an increased risk of radiation .
research suggests when sun is less active cosmic rays increase .
this lowers the amount of time an astronaut can safely stay in space .
it is predicted solar activity will continue to decrease in future .
this will mean male astronauts can only stay in space for 320 days .
and for females this is reduced to just 240 days .
these would be too short for a mission to mars , particularly for women .
