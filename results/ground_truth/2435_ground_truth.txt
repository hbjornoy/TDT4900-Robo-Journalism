andrew and neely moldovan , from dallas , texas , can not get their wedding photos until they pay $ 150 for an album cover .
their contract included a photo album but did not mention a cover ; they had assumed a book would come with a cover .
the couple , who paid photographer andrea polito $ 6,000 for the wedding , say they can afford the $ 150 but are refusing to pay on principle .
polito said she told the couple about the fee in an earlier meeting , which they deny .
