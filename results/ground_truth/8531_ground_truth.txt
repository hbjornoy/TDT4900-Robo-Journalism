emma tait says all her teeth had been filled by the time she was 13 .
she says dentists then continued to refill them rather than crowning them .
she says this mistake has caused them to crumble and fall out .
they are now so bad she ca n't chew food and is embarrassed to smile .
she is facing the prospect of extensive dental work to repair them .
but this could cost # 20,000 and she does n't know how she will fund it .
