the freedom ship is 25 storeys high and would feature a casino , an art gallery , a park and a shopping centre .
the concept , designed by a florida-based company would cost $ 10billion if was commissioned to be built .
the vessel could house 50,000 people but it would contain additional space to hold an extra 30,000 visitors .
the ship would constantly sail around the world - doing a full circuit every two years - but would be too large to enter any ports .
