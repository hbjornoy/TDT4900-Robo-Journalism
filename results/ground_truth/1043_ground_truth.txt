more than 50 animals have died in the last three months at indonesia 's surayaba zoo , a former keeper has claimed .
one giraffe died last year with 20kg of plastic bags in its stomach after they blew into its cage and were n't cleared .
in another case , a sumatran tiger 's digestive tract rotted away after it was routinely fed formaldehyde-laced meat .
a zoo spokesman defended the attraction , branded the worst in the world , but admitted : ` we also have issues '
