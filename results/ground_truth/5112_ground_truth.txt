medics found the wounded elephant dying in tsavo national park , kenya .
when they arrived they found poison arrow in its leg , shot by poachers .
they removed arrow and cleaned wound before giving him antibiotics .
happily , the bull elephant came to and hobbled off across the savannah .
but poaching in africa still sees one elephant killed every 15 minutes .
