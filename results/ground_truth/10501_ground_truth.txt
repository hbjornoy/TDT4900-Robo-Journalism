the pplkpr app syncs with a bluetooth heart rate monitor to track emotions .
when the monitor spots a change in heart rate the app alerts the user .
it asks the user to explain how they 're feeling , such as happy or scared .
over time , an algorithm learns the difference between different heart rates .
it then identifies people who cause stress , or who are a calming influence .
the app can even delete contacts it considers to be bad for the wearer .
