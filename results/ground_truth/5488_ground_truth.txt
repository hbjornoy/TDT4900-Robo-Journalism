moving around will aid recovery of muscles more than resting , doctors say .
dr gabe mirkin came up with rice technique for treating injuries in 1978 .
rice stands for rest , ice , compression and elevation .
now , he says that resting muscles or using ice packs delays recovery .
this is because ice causes blood vessels near to the injury to constrict .
that stops the flow of cells promoting healing into the muscle .
anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers like ibruprofen also delay healing .
