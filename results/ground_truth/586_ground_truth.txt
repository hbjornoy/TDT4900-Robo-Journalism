chris board , 37 , had his essex home damaged in a fire in may 2011 .
he repaired the roof with new timber but did not seek planning permission .
thought he did n't need it as changes did n't alter the house 's appearance .
he decided to admit to planning offences to avoid the expense of a trial .
now he has been fined # 1,000 and fears he will not be able to work again .
