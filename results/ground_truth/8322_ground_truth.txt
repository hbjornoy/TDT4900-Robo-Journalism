it is always going to be the case that i will have difficult times with lewis .
but our strength is we discuss what has happened and move on .
i was surprised to be called to the stewards in monaco - it was awkward .
it was clear that i had done nothing wrong on my way to securing pole .
winning in monaco for a second time was unreal and we had a great party .
