in 2011 , google insisted all google + users registered using their real name .
one reason was to prevent commenters posting abuse anonymously .
a similar restriction was extended to youtube last year .
google has now removed all restrictions on what names can be used .
it could lead to abusive comments to increase on google + and youtube .
