tiny version of tom daley was originally going to be topless horse riding russian president vladimir putin .
campaigners plotted to send the 6inch dolls to the kremlin in protest of russia 's treatment of gay people .
organisers decided to switch the russian premier for tom daley when the diver ` came out ' earlier this month .
a limited number of sets of the dolls are now available to buy via an online auction .
dolls ' creators are also planning to make a set of great british lesbians including clare balding and mary portas .
