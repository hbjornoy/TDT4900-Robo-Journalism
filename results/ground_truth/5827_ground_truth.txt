the kayan women wear coils around their necks to make them look longer .
their necks are not actually stretched - the weight of the brass pushes down the muscles around their collarbones and compresses their ribs .
this makes their necks look longer than they actually are .
it is not known why the women originally started wearing the neck rings .
now they do so as it is considered beautiful and to preserve the tradition .
a full set of the neck rings can weigh as much as 10 kilos .
