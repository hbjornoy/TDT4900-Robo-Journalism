the renwick ruin on manhattan 's roosevelt island in new york fell into disrepair after being in use for a century .
the hospital was constructed between 1854 and 1856 and for many years it was new york 's only such institution .
now the site is closed off and a $ 4.5 million renovation project is underway before the ruins open to the public .
