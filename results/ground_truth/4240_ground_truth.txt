the plane landed at taney county airport instead of branson airport , nine miles away .
an airline spokesman says he does n't know the plane landed in the wrong place , nor would the company name the veteran pilots .
the landing was uneventful and everyone on board is safe but some described landing dangerously close to the end of the runway .
