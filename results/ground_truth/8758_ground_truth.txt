a meeting of cardinals and bishops has signed off on the sainthood of pope john paul ii , whose tenure as pope ended with his death in 2005 .
the last step is the final approval of pope francis and a date for the ceremony which could be as soon as december 8 .
two miracles must be performed to rate a sainthood : the first of pope john paul ii was the curing of a nun of parkinson 's disease after she prayed for his intercession ; his second has not been revealed as yet .
