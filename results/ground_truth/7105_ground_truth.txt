the chin strap is made from a smart piezoelectric material known as pfc .
pfc is made up of integrated electrodes and adhesive polymer .
it produces electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to stress .
the maximum amount of power harvested was 18 microwatts .
but canadian researchers are working on increasing this output significantly .
