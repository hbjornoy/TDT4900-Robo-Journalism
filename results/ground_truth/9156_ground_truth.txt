emu was founded by ex-google and apple employee gummi hafsteinsson .
it works in a similar way to personal assistant apps google now and siri .
but , emu claims it is different because the app relies on ` machine learning ' this means it can learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions for users .
it works by monitoring conversations for contextual data , in real time .
if someone asks to meet up , it automatically checks a calendar , for example .
