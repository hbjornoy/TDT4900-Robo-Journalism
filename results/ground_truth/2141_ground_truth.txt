his one sorrow is not knowing how to find his three children from his first marriage back in exmoor .
michael ware married a local girl in a russian village three time-zones east of moscow , with a population of just 15 .
they now have three children together and work on a farm that is inaccessible for most of the year .
he is now known as mikhail and locals can not tell he is english - aside from his royal mail woollen hat .
did you know mr ware when he lived in britain ?
