high school senior melanie bailey was competing in cross country race .
she spotted rival danielle lenoue lying on the ground , sobbing in pain .
miss lenoue , who was 800 meters from finish , had torn patella tendon .
instead of running past her , miss bailey lifted competitor on to her back .
then carried her over the finish line in an incredible act of compassion .
since the race , the girls have been in contact and are now firm friends .
