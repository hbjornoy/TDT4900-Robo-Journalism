a two-story facility was built on camp leatherneck in southern afghanistan in spite of official warnings that it was unnecessary .
now a special inspector general is looking into why the building process went ahead anyway , and what will come of it now .
building is too costly for the afghan army to maintain , and the outlets wo n't even work for their equipment because they are american plugs .
just one of a handful of similar expensive projects that were laid to waste .
