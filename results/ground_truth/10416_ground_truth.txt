individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole .
it is said to have first developed among baby boomers , born after wwii .
experts studied baby names and birth rates over the past 150 years .
they also studied the changing use of ` individualistic ' words in books .
research said individualist behaviours began at the turn of 20th century .
and this was blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs .
