andy vernon and mo farah engaged in an argument on twitter this week .
vernon labelled the field against farah last weekend in birmingham ' a joke ' farah called the runner who finished second to him in the european championships ` an embarrassment ' now somali-born farah claims vernon said he did n't deserve to win gold at the european championships ahead of him because farah is not british .
vernon did not deny farah 's claims when asked on the subject .
many in the wider athletics community found farah 's comments arrogant .
