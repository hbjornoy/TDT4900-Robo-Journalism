the percentage of students from the lowest-income families has inched up just 3 points since 1970 , rising from 6 to 9 percent by 2013 .
the study comes amid renewed debate on college affordability spurred by president barack obama 's proposal to make two years of college free .
if adopted in every state , the proposal would benefit a projected 9 million students each year and cost taxpayers $ 60 billion over 10 years .
