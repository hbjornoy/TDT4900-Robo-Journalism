the new york city medical examiner 's office has confirmed that the remains found thursday night in queens belong to avonte oquendo .
but the office said it does not yet know how the 14-year-old died .
his family has said they fear foul play as the body was wearing different underwear than the type avonte wore .
he had not been seen since running away from his school on october 4 .
