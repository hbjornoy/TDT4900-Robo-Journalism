linguists from the university of miami examined 3,700 different languages .
they found languages with complex contrasting tones like cantonese , vietnamese and congolese are mainly found in humid areas of the world .
humidity makes the vocal cords more flexible and able to produce tones .
non-tonal languages like english , egyptian and mongolian originate in drier climates where vocal cords dehydrate and become imprecise .
