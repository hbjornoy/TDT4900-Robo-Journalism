french firm rougie plans to fatten a million ducks in china by 2020 .
the announcement comes after the duck liver delicacy failed to make it onto a new list of french foods approved by chinese authorities this week .
rougie 's parent , euralis , already accounts for a quarter of french national production of foie gras and began modest output in china in 2007 .
it has begun breeding work for a facility to house 500,000 ducks initially and aim for a million by 2020 , increasing china production by 50 per cent .
