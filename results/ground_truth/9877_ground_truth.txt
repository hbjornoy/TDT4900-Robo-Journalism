the yew hedge in the bathurst estate in cirencester is 40ft tall so the men use an elevated cherry picker to trim it .
but in days gone by they had to use wooden ladders and instead of a chainsaw , they used garden shears .
owner lord bathurst , who spends # 5,000 a year maintaining the 300-year-old hedge .
