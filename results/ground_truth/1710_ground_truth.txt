the abc facebook moderator accidentally sent a personal post about tucking your children into bed at night .
followers were amused by the mishap with one describing it as ` abc fail ' others could sympathise with the easy mistake with one saying ` definitely makes me feel like less of an idiot ' while other people seemed oblivious by just commenting on the topic of a mother 's guilt over giving enough time for their children .
