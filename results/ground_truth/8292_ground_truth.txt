scientists studied the argentina anserina across four lines of latitude .
they focused on the centres of the flowers , which look dark to bees .
study found dark centre was larger the nearer to equator flowers grew .
they predict that as earth receives more uv light due to global warming , flowers farther from the equator will also evolve these traits .
