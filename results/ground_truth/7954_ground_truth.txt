new hampshire sen. jeanne shaheen was asked if she approves of the job that president barack obama is doing .
she completely ignored the ` yes or no ' premise of the question , and replied , ` in some ways i approve , and some things i do n't approve ' the awkward incident took place at a debate last night against her republican opponent , former massachusetts sen. scott brown .
brown has made shaheen 's history of supporting the president 's agenda a key part of his offensive in the senate race .
