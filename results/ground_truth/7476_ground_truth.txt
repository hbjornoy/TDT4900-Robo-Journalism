margaret hall was left without any pain relief and in a public part of the building when she was dying at bupa 's eastbank care home in glasgow .
her daughter found her screaming in pain and asked for pain relief .
she was told it was not kept on site because of ` cost ' mrs hall died just before the medication was delivered to the home .
on a previous occasion her daughter found her lying shivering in a freezing cold bath because staff had forgotten she was there .
bupa has apologised to mrs hall 's family
