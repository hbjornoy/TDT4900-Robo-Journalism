steven martin , 50 , first smoked opium in 1992 in laos , where the last of the old chinese-style opium dens still existed .
martin says he never found a detailed , honest account by an opium addict , even during the drug 's heyday .
he came off the drug at thailand 's tham krabok monastery through buddhist monastic discipline and a vomit-inducing herbal drink .
addicts were lined up daily over a trough and given ` muddy potion ' to drink before vomiting ` torrents of rust-coloured puke ' he says people who lived near the monastery
