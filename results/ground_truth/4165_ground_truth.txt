wiltshire farmer tim daw , 52 , is building mound in field near marlborough .
it will have chambers full of shelves where urns of ashes will be placed .
chamber 's entrance is aligned so winter solstice sun will shine through it .
mr daw says he 's already had enquiries from people wanting to book space .
the mound 's design is based on that of nearby west kennet long barrow .
