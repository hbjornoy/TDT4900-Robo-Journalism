360 Â° video calling with virtual reality system was created by summit tech .
it uses the giroptic 360cam with a connected oculus rift headset .
when a call is received , it is routed through the recipient 's 360cam .
footage from the camera is then streamed to the caller 's oculus rift .
this makes it possible to have an immersive view of the place they are calling , as well as share the vr experience with others in real-time .
