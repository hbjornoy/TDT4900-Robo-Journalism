one month after his release from a cuban prison , alan gross received a chamber-wide standing ovation during tuesday 's address .
the aid worker had spent the past five years languishing in a cuban prison before being freed just before christmas .
gross still looked gaunt and was still minus most of his front teeth as he took pride of place as a guest of first lady michelle obama .
he broke out into a big smile and waved both fists triumphantly from the visitors ' gallery when president obama welcomed him home .
