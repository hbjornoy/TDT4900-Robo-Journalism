the illusion causes what 's known as a motion after-effect -lrb- mae -rrb- .
it is caused when visual neurons react to moving objects or stimulus .
cells that respond to motion in a clockwise direction become tired .
when the spinning stops , the cells sensitive to motion in the opposite direction become active .
this makes stationary objects look like they 're moving in that direction .
the phenomenon was first reported in texts written in ancient greek .
