google sent a team of people .
to map the city by foot , because the street view car and trike could not .
be used on venice 's narrow cobbled streets .
the team loaded the ` trekker ' onto a boat that navigated canals and dodged gondolas to map the city 's waterways .
users street view can travel the city by gondola , vaporetto -lrb- a larger boat that travels the length of the grand canal and the lagoon -rrb- or by foot .
