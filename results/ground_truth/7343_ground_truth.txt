prehistoric fish , such as the tiktaalik roseae , whose fins were strong , led to emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl onto land .
until now , scientists have been unsure exactly how this happened .
research shows certain fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists , fingers , ankles and toes .
they tracked how these fish genes changed how mice grew limbs .
