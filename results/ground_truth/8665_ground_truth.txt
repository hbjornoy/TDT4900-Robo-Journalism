dylan hartley was sent off for northampton against leicester on saturday .
luckily for his side they went on to win the match .
however that would not happen on the international stage against top quality opposition like south africa and new zealand .
sir clive woodward maintains hartley is a key player for england but he must be tamed or risk ruining england 's 2015 rugby world cup hopes .
head coach stuart lancaster must also take responsibility .
