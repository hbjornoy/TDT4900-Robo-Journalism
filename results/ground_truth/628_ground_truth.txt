the daredevil , 35 , walked a steep tightrope between two chicago skyscrapers on sunday and then crossed to another wearing a blindfold .
an average of 5.8 million people tuned into the discovery channel to watch and the number of viewers peaked at 6.7 million as he used the blindfold .
ratings fell far short of his grand canyon walk in 2013 , when an average of 8.5 million people tuned in - and 13 million watched the actual walk .
