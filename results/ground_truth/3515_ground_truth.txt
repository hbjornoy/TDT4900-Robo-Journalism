a canadian tourist was stuck dangling from a las vegas zip line attraction for nearly an hour friday .
the man took off from the 12-story zip line slot machine and the trolley that ran along the cable jammed .
the company gave the man a full refund and offered him and his wife a nice dinner at a local restaurant .
