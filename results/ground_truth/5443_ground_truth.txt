sam standerwick , 41 , from tredegar , enjoyed watersports as a child .
took up kayaking again at 40 but realised she needed to lose weight .
calorie crunching was n't for her - she ate 2,000 a day but worked out .
completed two half-marathons , three 10k races and 26 5k races .
she used to squeeze into size 28 clothes but has now dropped to size 14 .
