catholic church includes gay and lesbian issues at synod for the first time .
vatican meeting will discuss how better to serve its homosexual members .
move has been welcomed as ' a crack in the ice ' by gay rights groups .
decision bears hallmarks of progressive attitude church has adopted on sexuality since pope francis ' famous ` who am i to judge ?
' comment last year .
however conservative catholics say their views on gays will ` never ' change .
