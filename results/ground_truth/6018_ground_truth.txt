more than 100 dolphins rode the wave simultaneously in western australia .
they are shown lining up to wait for the swell , just like human surfers do .
a wildlife photographer filmed the scene from above using a remote controlled quadcopter mounted with a camera .
the camera 's view could only capture 30 of the creatures at any one time .
no-one is certain why dolphins ` surf ' , but experts think it is just for fun .
