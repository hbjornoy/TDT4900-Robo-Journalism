moeen ali has taken 19 wickets over the course of four tests against india .
what has been most impressive is the way he has taken criticism on board and used it to improve his game .
as a result he looks much more settled playing at test level for england .
before the third test , ian bell took him aside and told him to be more consistent with his deliveries and pace rather than mixing things up .
ali was in sensational form during the fourth test victory at old trafford .
