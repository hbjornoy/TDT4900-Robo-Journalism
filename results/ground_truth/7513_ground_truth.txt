atlanta djs nick cellini , steak shapiro and chris dimino were fired on monday after the jibe about ex-new orleans saints safety steve gleason .
gleason , who battles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , ca n't talk or move but communicates with the help of eye-tracking technology .
pretending to be the ex-nfl star , the djs asked to be ` smothered ' gleason said in a statement that he accepts the men 's ` genuine ' apologies and hopes the incident brings much-needed attention to the disease .
