lancaster university claims homes and workplaces are too warm .
office temperatures are traditionally designed for people wearing suits .
as fewer people wear suits , and dress more casually , offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels .
this means heat is being wasted , which has an impact on global climates .
instead of heating and cooling offices , the university recommends dressing in hoodies and jeans .
