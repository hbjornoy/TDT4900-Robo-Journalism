unicode consortium , which sets the standards for emojis , has unveiled plans to add five new skin colours for the cartoon-like pictograms .
people could create more representative icons at the touch of a button .
emojis are popular in texts and social media , but there have been calls for them to be made ethnically diverse , as most of the pictograms are white .
unicode consortium 's proposal is still under review .
