research shows a big difference between mortgage refusal rates depending on ethnic group .
one reason for the disparity is whites tend to make more money than blacks and hispanics , which makes qualifying for a loan much easier .
prices in black and hispanic neighborhoods grew faster during the economic boom , but fell even harder when the housing bubble burst .
the difference in home ownership between black and white households is the same now as it was in 1900 .
