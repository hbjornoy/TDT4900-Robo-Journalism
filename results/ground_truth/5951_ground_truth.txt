in a 2010 senate vote , republicans failed to block the obamacare regulation responsible for as many as 5 million insurance cancellations .
the vote was 59-40 , with every democrat opposed .
sen. rand paul told a partisan crowd last week that the rule was never part of the affordable care act , but was tacked on later by the white house .
the so-called ` grandfather ' clause virtually guarantees the cancellation of private health insurance policies that change in any way from year to year .
