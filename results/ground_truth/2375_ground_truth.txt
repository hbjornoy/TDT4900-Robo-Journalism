the incredible sounds are the work of ice music , an orchestra from sweden .
instruments were carved from ice before adding strings and fret boards .
they are tuned after each performance as breath of musicians melts them .
songs are performed inside an igloo-like -10 Â°c hall , also covered in ice .
