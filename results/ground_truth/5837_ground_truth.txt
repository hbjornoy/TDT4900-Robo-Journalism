chimerix chief kenneth moch says they will now offer josh hardy the anti-viral treatment he needs .
hardy , seven , is battling a viral infection following a bone marrow transplant .
a drug called brincidofovir made by north carolina company chimerex could clear up the infection in two weeks .
brincidofovir has not received fda approval but has been administered for ` compassionate use ' to hundreds of patients .
previously moch said the company no longer has a compassionate use program because it can not afford it .
