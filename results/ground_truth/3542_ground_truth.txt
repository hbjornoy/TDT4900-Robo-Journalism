new system , called ` artisan ' , tested by sailors off coast of portland today .
it tracked sea-skimming target , before passing data to a seawolf missile .
missile was then launched into the air and blasted the object out of sky .
first time system had been used to track target ahead of missile launch .
it can track 800 objects simultaneously - even if they are 125 miles away .
it has been deemed a success - and could be used by navy in the future .
