vervia 's fiance died at war and after her father died she lived alone .
each year she travelled abroad and filled suitcases with designer clothes .
arriving home she would stash the pieces away unworn .
she closed off rooms full of clothes in her county durham townhouse .
one dress was even found hidden up the chimney .
it has taken a year to sort the incredible collection ready for sale .
