zari , a 7-year-old african lioness , was captured on camera as she pawed at the glass of her enclosure trying to reach a baby on the other side .
she is one of four lions who live at the zoo in el paso , texas , making it her home since 2010 .
the zoo reminds viewers that the glass is very thick , keeping the baby well out of harms way .
