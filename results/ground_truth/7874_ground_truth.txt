massachusetts institute of technology researchers have developed a method to detect hazardous gases and pollutants .
they modified nfc chips to make them detect things in their environment .
when a phone came near it could then be given the information .
the technology could be improved to send alerts over distances .
for example , when vegetables in your fridge go off , the sensor could trigger a device that sends a reminder to your phone to get more food .
it could also be used to detect explosives in packages .
