scientists from the university of cambridge 's graphene centre created the keyboard from graphene-based electronic ink printed on a plastic film .
they think graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin sensors .
the new material is cheap , environmentally stable and does not require much processing .
after printing in comparison to other conductive inks .
