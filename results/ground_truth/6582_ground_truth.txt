photo of female kurdish fighter became a symbol of kobane 's resistance .
she was seen making peace sign while signing up to fight islamic state .
terrorists said they later beheaded ` rehana ' , sharing a sickening image .
but friends now say dead woman in photograph fact not actually rehana .
claimed she was able to escape kobane and now lives in southern turkey .
do you know rehana ?
