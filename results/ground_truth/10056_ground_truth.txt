one in four british men said parental leave should not be shared equally .
fathers had previously been allowed a two-week period of paternity leave .
from today , fathers could in theory take almost one year away from work .
however , 12 per cent of men said they would take the maximum available .
the new scheme could cost employers up to # 17 million in the first year .
almost half of men surveyed said they were happy taking just two weeks .
