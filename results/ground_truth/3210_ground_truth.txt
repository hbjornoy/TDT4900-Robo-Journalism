woodpeckers can peck trees at a high .
frequency and at high speeds equivalent to seven metres per .
second without suffering any brain injury .
engineers at dalian university of technology in north eastern china built a 3d computer model of a woodpecker to examine how the impact is absorbed .
they found its skull and beak structure reduces the impact on its brain .
and the bird 's body stores over 99 per cent of energy from impacts .
insight could lead to better cars and space craft that can withstand crashes .
