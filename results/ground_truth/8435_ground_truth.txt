tokyo-based software engineer cameron beccario has created a weather map that looks like the infamous star wars character jabba the hutt .
the animation shows wind speeds and weather patterns around the world .
in the image jabba 's ` eyes ' are represented by two vortices .
his mouth is an area that circles earth near the equator where northeast and southeast trade winds come together .
mr beccario told mailonline he ` could n't stop laughing ' when he saw the face appear in his visualisation .
