sean yetman , 30 , was spotted dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he could n't possibly have been awarded .
purple heart recipient ryan berk confronted him and footage of their chat has been viewed more than 2.7 million times since friday .
yetman could now be charged with committing a federal crime .
court documents show that in 2003 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a cop .
yetman has n't spoken out about the allegations , but his fianc√©e said he has ` spiraled into a deep depression ' since the video surfaced .
