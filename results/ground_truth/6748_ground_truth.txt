syrian rebels were joined by extremist group jabhat al-nusra in the attack last night .
the rebels overtook an air defence base near the village of al-taaneh , east of aleppo .
a spokesman for the revolutionary council in aleppo said government raids on friday morning had destroyed much of the rockets at the base .
rebels now fear extremists are taking advantage of the lack of organisation to gather weapons for their own cause .
