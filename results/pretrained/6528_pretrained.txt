officers from the royal gibraltar police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas .
spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving gibraltar for the mainland yesterday , causing six-hour traffic jams in 30c heat .
the move follows a stand-off with the royal navy as they attempted to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the bay of gibraltar last week .
