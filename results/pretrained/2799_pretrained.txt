camilo villegas produced a sparkling eight-under-par 63 to claim the first-round lead in the wyndham championship at sedgefield country club in greensboro , north carolina .

colombian villegas and american trio scott langley , heath slocum and andrew loupe were two shots off the pace after signing for 65s .
