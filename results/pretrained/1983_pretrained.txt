graham cowley , owner of hill farm house in crowland , is understandably upset as his property could be covered by 500 acres of solar panels and five wind turbines only 100 yards from his front door .
mr cowley said there was no evidence of the scheme when his solicitors carried out searches before he spent # 225,000 on his home in newborough , cambridgeshire , and a further # 18,000 building a garage .
