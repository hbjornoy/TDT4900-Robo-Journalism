jenna murray , 29 , bought the # 3 supper of smoked mackerel , new potatoes and beetroot after work from her local store in camden , north london .
it came with a creamy mustard and dill dressing and was ready to cook .
she claims she leapt from the table in disgust , dashed to her bathroom and vomited .
