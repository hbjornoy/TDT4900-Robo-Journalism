anna marinenko , from kiev , ukraine , has drawn 12 beards in various stages of growth , beginning with january 's designer stubble and finally ending in a full woodsman 's beard in december .
each stage is printed on transparent paper , making the fuzz seem bushier as the year goes on , and the pages are laid over each other .
