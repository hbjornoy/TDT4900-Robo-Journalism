professor curzen , a consultant cardiologist at southampton general hospital , said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted .
the tests , called angiograms , involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart .
the test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but does n't always get it right .
