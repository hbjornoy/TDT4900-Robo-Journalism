england midfielder adam lallana has pulled out of the england squad to face lithuania and italy .
the midfielder 's groin injury flared up in the 2-1 defeat to manchester united on sunday and he will therefore miss the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday .
the squad are due to meet at st george 's park at lunchtime , but it is understood lallana will not be among them .
