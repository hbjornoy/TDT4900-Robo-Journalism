george groves held an open training session in west london ahead of his fight with carl froch .
the pair come face in an eagerly anticipated rematch after froch was controversially adjudged to have beaten groves last november .
groves went through some shadow work before working on the pads with his trainer paddy fitzgerald .
the londoner laughed off those assertions in an open workout in shepherd 's bush on tuesday afternoon .
