tara mcintyre , 24 , was left virtually wheelchair-bound after ben hagon 's high-powered mercedes sports car crashed into her at up to 75mph .
hagon was overtaking a line of cars on the a131 at high garrett , essex , when he ploughed into the side of miss mcintyre 's ford ka .
hagon , who already had a conviction for drink-driving in 2003 , had taken prescription tranquilisers and was more than twice the legal alcohol limit .
