a foot-long alligator was found underneath an escalator at chicago 's o'hare international airport on friday in terminal 3 , chicago police spokesman said .
the alligator was taken to the airport via train and then probably freed after the person realized they were n't going to be able to get past security with it .
the animal is now being cared for by the chicago herpetological society .
