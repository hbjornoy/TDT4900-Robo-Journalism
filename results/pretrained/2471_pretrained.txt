images were taken by danish photographer ulrik pedersen , who spent two weeks travelling around the one-party state last month .
the couple are photographed sitting on the grass near a fountain in pyongyang , north korea , just after their big day .
pedersen said the journey left him convinced that north korea is actually worse than most people think because they are hiding so much .
