their father robert stone , 56 , arrived at the scene of the accident and cried : ` not again , no , not another child .
i know jennie is up there now and she would not have wanted rosie-ann to be prosecuted ' mr stone said : ` we begged the crown prosecution service not to bring this charge , but they seem to have their own agenda '
