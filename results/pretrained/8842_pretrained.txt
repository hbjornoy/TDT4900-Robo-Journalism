the state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a # 446million loss for the first three months of the year .
rbs was also hit with a # 453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the us .
the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time for chancellor george osborne , six days before the general election .
