the heavily-armed gunmen ambushed the bus early this morning as it headed for nairobi from mandera , a town that lies on the border with somalia .
the extremists reportedly separated the muslims from the 28 victims by forcing them to read verses from the koran and killed them if they failed .
the death toll - which included 19 men and nine women , were shot in the head at point-blank range alongside the other victims .
