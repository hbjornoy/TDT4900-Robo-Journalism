the promotion will last from october 20 to january 18 , allowing families and businesses to make savings by sending larger items at a reduced rate .
the size of a ` small parcel ' - currently 45cm x 35cm x 16cm - is permanent and will remain in place after the january 18 deadline , but the maximum weight limit will return to one kilo or under .
there are currently separate prices for parcels weighing more or less than one kilo , even if their packaging is the same size .
