the cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in half moon bay , 400 miles northwest of the mojave desert where it was erected in 1934 .
the cross had been encased in a wooden box as a result of a decade-long legal battle over its existence between the vfw and the american civil liberties union .
the national park service confirmed that it was the same mojave memorial cross that went missing in 2010 .
