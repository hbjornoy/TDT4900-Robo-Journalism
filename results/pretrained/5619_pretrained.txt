yaya toure was subjected to more racist abuse in the build-up to manchester city 's champions league clash with cska moscow .
the two teams were forced to play behind closed doors in moscow two weeks ago due to uefa sanctions against cska at the etihad .
city boss manuel pellegrini said the issue will have no bearing on toure 's participation in wednesday 's group e tie against cska .
