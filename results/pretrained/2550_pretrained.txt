the ` misinformed announcement ' near a boarding area apparently stemmed from a police pursuit of an unarmed driver that ended outside terminal 2 .
the man , who was in the terminal at the time , said he hid behind a pillar and saw an elderly woman fall and get partially trampled but did n't appear to be injured .
the fire department took him to a hospital for treatment of an unspecified condition .
