the ancient known shell to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a dutch museum collection , where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s .
the shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings , suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping .
it may mean our ancestors , homo erectus , were more intelligent than we thought .
