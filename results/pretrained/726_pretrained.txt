newly-opened north durham academy , which opened this month in stanley , county durham , boasts of its state-of-the-art design .
the club , which appears from the outside to be ` the spa hotel ' was subject to vigorous resistance from local residence when its true intentions became apparent in 2004 .
the underground dungeon is also shown , featuring leather and chains , padded tables and a man-sized wheel to which guests can be strapped .
locals still campaign against the establishment , which they say is ` unsuitable ' for the location .
