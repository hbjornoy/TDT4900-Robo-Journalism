mudstones from gale crater , the landing site of the curiosity rover , were formed in a lake that may have existed on the planet for hundreds of years .
the 150 kilometre-wide -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- impact basin , with a mountain at its centre , is believed to have supported the lake - and possibly more than one - around 3.6 billion years ago .
