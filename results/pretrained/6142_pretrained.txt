police are hunting these baby-faced robbers after a 12-year-old schoolboy had his bike stolen during an attack earlier this month .
one of the boys kicked him and pinned him down while the other plundered an iphone 4s from his pocket .
the boys , who look distinctively young , targeted the youngster who was cycling in woodland in blackley , greater manchester .
