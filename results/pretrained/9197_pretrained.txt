new zealand chart-topper lorde sent joe irvine cupcakes and a touching note after he was roasted by british singers natalia kills and willy moon .
irvine tweeted : ` just wanted to say that no matter how many people make fun of me for how i dress , move and act , i 'm being me -- and that 's what 's important .
good luck and lots of love , lorde , positive energy and spirit are infectious !
