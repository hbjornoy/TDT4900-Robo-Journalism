the us drone strike took place in the town of datta khel in north waziristan , where pakistani troops have been carrying out a major operation against local and foreign militants .
in a separate operation , officials say pakistani security forces also killed seven ` terrorists ' on the outskirts of peshawar - where the atrocity unfolded on tuesday morning .
the weapon has eliminated several top militants - but has also resulted in civilian casualties , making it extremely unpopular among pakistanis .
