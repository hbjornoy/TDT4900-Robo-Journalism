foreign chefs , bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in australia from july 1 .
the three professions have been added to the skilled occupation list which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa .
the changes were made following advice from the australian workforce and productivity agency based on labour market , education and training .
