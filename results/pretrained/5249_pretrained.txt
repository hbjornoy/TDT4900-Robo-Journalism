the statue of sekhemka , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by northampton borough council for # 15.76 m last year to a mystery buyer abroad .
the statue , which dates from 2,400 bc , is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife , son and seven offering bearings .
mr vaizey praised the figure as a work of ` outstanding aesthetic importance ' and ` the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world '
