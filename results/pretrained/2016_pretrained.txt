demi baines leapt on her mother karen to pull her to the ground and stop her daughter as the six-year-old 's face was bitten and torn by his staffordshire bull terrier .
jurors were told the 70-year-old then lay on top of miss baines as demi was being savaged and drunkenly slurred to the dog .
the dog was allegedly so drunk that he struggled to stand .
the christmas day attack outside rhodes 's home in hyde , greater manchester , last year almost severed demi 's bottom lip and left her with wounds to her arm and back .
