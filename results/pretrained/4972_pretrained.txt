tim ward , sales and distribution director at albert bartlett potatoes , said his firm aims to produce potatoes no bigger than 50mm in diameter .
he said the problem was being exacerbated by a huge surplus of potatoes across europe and the rest of the uk .
the crop is in stark contrast to last year , when snow , frost and rain caused major delays to the jersey royal season and led to 10,000 tonnes fewer being exported .
