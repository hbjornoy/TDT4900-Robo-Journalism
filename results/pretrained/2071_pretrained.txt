baljit singh bhandal , who built updown court , has lost his claim for compensation over the seizure of the property .
he was accused of smuggling duty-free alcohol out of the bonded warehouse where it was part of an investigation into his business - but his prosecution on fraud charges subsequently collapsed .
bhandal bought updown court in the 1990s after it had been practically gutted by the great storm of 1987 , and rebuilt the interiors in a lavish style .
