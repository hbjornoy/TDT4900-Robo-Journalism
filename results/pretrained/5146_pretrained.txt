alannah hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin .
she was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanoma and if she had waited another three months the cancer would have spread and become terminal but she has a ` very good ' prognosis .
hill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh .
