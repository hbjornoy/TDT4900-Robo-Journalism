alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas found butch , a homeless and dying boston terrier , the week before thanksgiving and lavished him with attention for a few days until he had to be put down .
the dog , who had a swollen heart , experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life .
the vet suggested he had almost no lung capacity , his trachea was leaking and his heart was swollen .
