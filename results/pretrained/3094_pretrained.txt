when janet and barry ashdown bought their home in holderness , east yorkshire in 1986 one of the main attractions was the large extended double garage , which had been recently built .
the problem became apparent when the retired couple , who are looking to rebuild their garage , noticed that the previous owners had n't registered the extension with land registry .
the ashdowns even have a letter from the former holderness borough council in 1985 .
