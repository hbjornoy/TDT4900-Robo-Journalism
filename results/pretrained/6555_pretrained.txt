underwater photographer regan mizuguchi was busy taking pictures of himself off the kohala coast in hawaii when the fish swam into shot and decided it wanted to be famous .
mr mizuguchi said : ` it was only after i reviewed the images that i noticed it had completely blocked out my face in one of the shots , i could n't believe how perfect it was , so i stayed still and carried on taking photos '
