the bronze age wooden structure was first discovered in the late 1990s on the beach by holme-next-to-sea , and tests have now revealed it dates back to the summer of 2049 bc .
the timbers came from a circle 21ft -lrb- 6.6 m -rrb- in diameter , comprising 55 closely-fitted oak posts , each originally up to 10ft -lrb- 3 metres -rrb- in length .
experts believe the upturned stump was a final resting place for an important person .
