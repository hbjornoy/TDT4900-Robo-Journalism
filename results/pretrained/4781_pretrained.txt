the female cub was bought by a family in the city of peja when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in their apartment .
three weeks later , not only did local police rescue ema from the flat in peja , she has also been introduced to two other cubs - of the same age .
charity workers think the trio could be related but will have to carry out further medical checks to be certain .
