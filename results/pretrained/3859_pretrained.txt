geologists detected 342 tremors with epicentres within 150 metres -lrb- 492 feet -rrb- of a cement plant in ghigiano , umbria in northern italy .
they had attributed the vibrations to movements of magma bubbling near the surface of the earth 's crust beneath the country .
they found 85 percent appeared spatially on or near rifts while 97 per cent appeared adjacent to a type of fault known as a subvertical fault .
