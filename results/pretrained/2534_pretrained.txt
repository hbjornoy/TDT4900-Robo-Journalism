pictures were taken by florida photographer jim zielinski , 43 , who had posed up the shot in his back garden in the sunshine state .
but the animal did not know that he was being caught on camera by a string of a horse 's head to munch on a peanut hidden inside it .
he said : ` the branch i tied it to was right above where we feed the squirrels by hand so they are used to eating there '
