rebel conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with mps from labour and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the uk 's reserve forces .
the move , led by basildon tory mp john baron , could potentially threaten a coalition scheme to remove 20,000 full-time personnel and beef up what used to be called the territorial army .
mr baron said : ` we ca n't use a commons vote to tell the ministry of defence what size the army should be but we can raise questions about the replacement reservist plan '
