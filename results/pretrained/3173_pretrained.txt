she is relishing being part of buffalo 's efforts to revitalize its waterfront and draw people year-round , even when the lake erie breeze is something more endured than enjoyed .
the bikes give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice , along with the warm nuts , hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks .
