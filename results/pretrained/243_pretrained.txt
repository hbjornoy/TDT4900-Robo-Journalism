velvet wrap , which comes in a range of colours , is one of the latest trends in super car customisation .
the car , a phantom drophead coupe , was spotted outside harrods in the exclusive area of knightsbridge , central london , where it attracted a few looks - and strokes - from passers-by .
the wrap is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather conditions .
