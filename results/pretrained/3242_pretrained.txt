the shark sighting comes after the west australian government 's catch and kill trial program ended earlier this year .
the shark , believed to be a great white , has forced surfers and swimmers out of the water at popular perth beaches as it continues to swim south .
the great white has not come close to shore but all beaches in surrounding areas have been cleared .
