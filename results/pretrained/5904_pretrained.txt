malcolm hingle , 52 , had to have his left leg amputated following a motorbike crash in 2006 .
the device is made from flexible carbon fibre and has been specially cut to fit a prosthetic knee that enables mr hingle to peddle normally .
the # 5,000 socket has been designed so that it will not rub against his stump and cause blisters .
