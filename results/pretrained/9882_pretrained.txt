boxer curtis woodhouse was so incensed by the vitriolic comments he received from one twitter user he offered a cash reward for the man 's address and drove to confront him on his doorstep .
he was branded a ` waste of s **** ' and was urged to retire by sheffield-based user jimmyob88 , so woodhouse offered # 1,000 to anyone who could help him find him .
