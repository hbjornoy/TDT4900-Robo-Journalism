hubble telescope snapped the surprising multiple images with the help of a galaxy cluster that acted as a natural magnifying lens .
the supernova could be seen because its light took different paths around the cluster located between the exploded star and the earth-orbiting telescope .
it enables telescopes like hubble to see objects that would otherwise be too faint and far away .
this will combine the power of hubble with the natural amplification caused by strong gravitational lensing of distant galaxy clusters to study the past universe .
