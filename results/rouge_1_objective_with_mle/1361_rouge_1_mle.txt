olivia adams , 13 , was told the green and red tags on her kickers shoes broke an ` all-black ' uniform rule at the north school in ashford , kent .
she was shocked when a staff member apparently knelt down and cut off the tags - while the shoes were on her feet .
the row has since escalated when olivia was suspended for a week for naming the teacher on facebook .
