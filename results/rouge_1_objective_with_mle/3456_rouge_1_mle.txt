city councilman justin wilson introduced legislation for tuesday night 's council meeting to do away with a 1963 law that requires a certain number of new streets to be named for long-dead confederate generals .
wilson 's bill also would repeal a ban on ` lewd cohabitation ' and laws .
he said he wants to remove a series of anachronistic laws , and the city will be naming new streets any time soon .
