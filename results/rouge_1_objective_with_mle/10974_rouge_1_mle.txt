joachim low , the coach of germany , took a leaf out of sir alex ferguson 's book of football management when he appealed for marco rodriguez to referee strongly and ` clamp down on things ' in the world cup semi-final with brazil .
low has not been impressed with the brutality of some of the tackles at world cup .
low claimed that the refereeing standards in european football are better in a clear attempt to influence the mexican referee .
