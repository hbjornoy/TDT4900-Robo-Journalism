feng mingshan , 54 , has to climb a 50 metre vertical cliff to reach the entrance of his unusual home where he has lived in the cave to help him get in and out of his remote house .
feng moved out of gaoba town , in northwest china 's shaanxi province , in 1993 because he did not want to be around other people .
he has worked at enlarging the interior of his cave and has eschewed almost every modern convenience .
