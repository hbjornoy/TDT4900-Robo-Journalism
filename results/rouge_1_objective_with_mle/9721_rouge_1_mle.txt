david cameron is the most intelligent political leader in britain .
the tories are backed by 33 per cent of voters , according to the latest ashcroft survey .
mr cameron has been boosted by his hardline stance against arch-federalist jean-claude juncker becoming president of the european commission .
the survey will send shockwaves through the labour party , which has become embroiled in a fresh bout of infighting over its ability to win the next election .
