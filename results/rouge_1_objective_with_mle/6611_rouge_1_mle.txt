nigel pearson was involved in an extraordinary clash with crystal palace midfielder james mcarthur in the dying minutes of the 1-0 home defeat .
pearson laughingly put his hands round mcarthur 's throat then helped him to his feet but then refused to sign mcarthur last summer .
the leicester city manager was accidentally upended as marc albrighton and mcarthur collided with alan pardew .
