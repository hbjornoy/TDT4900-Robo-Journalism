radamel falcao has been reduced to tears by his manchester united nightmare .
silvano espindola revealed that falcao phoned him from old trafford last week before he was made to play for the under 21s against tottenham .
the 29-year-old striker also expressed fears that he risked a recurrence of his serious knee injury by playing against lower-grade opposition .
