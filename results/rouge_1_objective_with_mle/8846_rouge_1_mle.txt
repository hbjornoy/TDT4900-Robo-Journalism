julian assange , an australian , is working on a range of clothes for indian customers in partnership with local company franchisee india .
he has been living in the ecuadorian embassy in london since 2012 , when the uk decided to extradite him to sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault .
the 43-year-old co-founded wikileaks in 2006 and shot to fame in 2010 when he was wanted on sunday for a speech at the nantucket project , a massachusetts innovation conference .
he is believed the line will feature a stylised image of assange 's face , similar to clothing featuring the face of south american revolutionary che guevara .
