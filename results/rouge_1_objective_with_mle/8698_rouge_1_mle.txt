researchers from the university of hafia , israel , found multiple impressions of saliva and mint under human skeletons in four separate graves at the raqefet cave .
the earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with plants - dating back 13,700 years - was discovered last summer in a raqefet cave , mount carmel , israel .
it was also hoped the scent of the plants would stop animals being attracted to the grave to dig up the body .
