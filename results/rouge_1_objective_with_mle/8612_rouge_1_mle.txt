latvia has warned the swedish hunt for a russian submarine spotting in its water could become a security ` game changer ' in the baltic sea .
the swedish military today began their fifth day of searchers , after yesterday closing off waters and airspace off stockholm and widening their search area from 30 miles to 45 miles southeast of the capital .
the terminal will be key to lithuania 's plans to reduce its reliance on russian energy .
