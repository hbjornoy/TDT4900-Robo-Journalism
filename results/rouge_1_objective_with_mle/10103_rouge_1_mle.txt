the winter ` bomb ' , descending south from canada , is expected to turn eastward early next week , dropping spotty snow , rain and a wintry mix of rain and snow from the carolinas to maine and into canada as a mass of cold arctic air descends over the northeast and east coast .
models suggest the storm will rapidly intensify tuesday night and wednesday , qualifying as an ` explosive development ' or bombgenesis .
the storm is moving from the gulf of alaska and will travel southeastward into british columbia and the northern rockies over the weekend .
