the obama administration defended the communications network called zunzuneo , which drew 40,000 users in cuba in two years , saying the programme was ` invested and debated ' in congress .
the white house has insisted that the creation of its ` cuban twitter ' programme was not a covert operation .
zunzuneo was partly funded by the us agency for international aid and was said to be aimed at young cubans .
