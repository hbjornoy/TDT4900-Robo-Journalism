the redgrave park estate , near bury st edmunds , suffolk , has gone up for sale for nearly # 6million but has no stately home due to the mansion being demolished after the second world war .
redgrave hall was built in the 16th century before its owners brought in famous gardener capability brown to design the grounds in the late 18th century .
the couple converted a large stable block on the grounds into a six-bedroom cottage where they live today .
the new owner wants a stately home to match the grandeur of the huge parkland .
