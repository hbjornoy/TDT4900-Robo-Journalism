the qt hotel group came up with a menu of 14 items .
some hotel guests have a hard time resisting the urge to pilfer anything they can get their hands on , with robes , coat hangers , slippers and sheets being common temptations .
the menu , entitled desire , was placed in all of their suites to remind guests that any stolen items would be appearing on their bill .
