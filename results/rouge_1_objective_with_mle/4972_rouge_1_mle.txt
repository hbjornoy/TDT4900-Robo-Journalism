good growing conditions has meant this year 's crop of jersey royals have grown larger than usual .
supermarkets are refusing to buy them and frustrated farmers are having to give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields .
the massive crop is in stark contrast to last year , when snow , frost and rain caused major delays to the jersey royal season and led to 10,000 tonnes fewer being exported .
