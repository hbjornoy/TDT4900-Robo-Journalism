defense attorney kirk nurmi began closing arguments in arias ' sentencing retrial by showing photos from happy moments in her life , such as an image of arias resting her chin on boyfriend travis alexander 's shoulder amid a forested background .
arias was convicted in 2013 of murdering alexander in a jealous rage because he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to mexico with another woman .
the attorney said arias ' problems stem from a personality disorder in which she tries to mold herself to the wishes of the men she dates .
