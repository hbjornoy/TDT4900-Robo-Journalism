two rival newsreaders , the bbc 's kate silverton and sky 's isabel webster , were inches from a horror crash by london 's hammersmith bridge at 1pm yesterday .
ms webster , 32 , said it was a miracle no one was killed in the drama , which ended in the 16-year-old being arrested and is still being questioned by police .
the bizarre coincidence happened yesterday in the west london district of hammersmith , home to bbc veteran kate silverton .
