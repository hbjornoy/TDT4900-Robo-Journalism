police have formed an unprecedented ring of steel around the 18-acre bucklebury manor estate in berkshire .
the local council imposed no-stopping regulations on roads near the georgian home where a team of armed royal guards , who accompany kate and william everywhere , are also stationed .
the couple spent a week at bucklebury manor shortly before kate returned to london to give birth , and the cambridges were back last night surrounded by police .
