reverend lindsay hardin freeman led a three-year search of the bible 's new revised standard version to count every single word spoken by females .
the study found that women speak a total of 14,056 words in the bible - and they speak only 1.1 per cent of the time .
the women met and studied the book in the trinity episcopal church in excelsior , minnesota , where freeman was serving as rector when the research started .
