tennessee democratic rep. steve cohen made the idea part of his brainstorm in a q-and-a session with acting secret service director joseph clancy during a capitol hill hearing .
the secret service would be better able to protect the president and his family if the white house needed a six-foot moat to deter deranged people from sprinting across the president 's lawn and bursting into his home .
clancy is playing mop-up after former chief julia pierson 's resignation , apologizing to congress for hooker scandals , security breaches and a shooting .
