david cameron 's decision to remove michael gove is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price .
gove is the one man in the cabinet who entered office with a clear vision of what he needed to change in his department and proceeded to force through his reforms against visceral resistance from the left , teachers and his own civil servants .
he has been a lightning conductor for their hatred .
