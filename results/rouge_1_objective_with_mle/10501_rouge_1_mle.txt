the pplkpr app -lrb- right -rrb- syncs with a bluetooth heart rate monitor -lrb- left -rrb- to track and log subtle changes in emotional state .

the free ios app was created by brooklyn-based artists kyle mcdonald and lauren mccarthy , and was recently tested on a group of students at carnegie mellon university .
