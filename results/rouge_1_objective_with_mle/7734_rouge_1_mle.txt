pizza hut japan has embraced people 's obsession with cat videos and created their own video series where cats run a fictional store called pizza cat .
the webisodes star four felines who run pizza cat and show each `` employee '' doing various jobs like taking orders , delivering money and vacuuming the floors .
the campaign is completely lost in the cuteness but it goes down well for anyone needing a laugh .
