new lotion has been developed to kill off head lice in a single 10 minute application without the need for a nit comb for the eggs .
the new treatment , developed by an australian pharmaceutical company , has gone through final clinical trials in the us food and drug administration with results showing that 81.5 per cent of subjects were free of lice after the one dose without nit combing .
there are plans to submit a new drug application with fda in the first half of 2015 and the treatment is expected to be sold in pharmacies in early 2016 .
