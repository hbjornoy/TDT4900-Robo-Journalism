eric klein , from newton , north carolina , was just five miles from hickory regional airport when he realized that he was dangerously low on fuel around 11pm on monday .
he immediately looked for a safe place to land and after considering a parking lot - and realizing it was too full of people - he turned his attentions towards u.s. 321 .
the two drivers , gerald cole and joe greene were stunned to see the plane appear beside them , stopped their vehicles and ran to check if klein was harmed .
