the sweetly-named pay de limon - or lemon pie - was discovered whining and bleeding in a dumpster after its run-in with heartless criminals in mexico city in 2011 .
a year on the plucky pooch has recovered well thanks to the efforts of the milagros caninos - canine miracles - rescue centre in the mexican capital , which raised almost # 4,000 to pay for pay for the prosthetic limbs that would allow him to walk .
the founder of the rescue shelter claimed pay de 's horrifying injuries were the work of criminals using the dog to ` practice ' the torturous treatments dished out to kidnap victims by members of mexico 's notorious drug cartels .
