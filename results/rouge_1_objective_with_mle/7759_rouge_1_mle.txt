police minister damian green mistakenly signed a new law to allow england 's most notorious football hooligans to attend the world cup finals this summer .
the blunder would have left 2,500 of the worst troublemakers free to cause mayhem , but the dates were wrong and he barred them from just the opening day instead of the entire tournament .
the law was laid before parliament on january 29 , but mistakenly added it would end on june 2 , ten days before the opening ceremony .
