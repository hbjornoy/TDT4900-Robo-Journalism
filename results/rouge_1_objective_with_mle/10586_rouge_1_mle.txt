mayur naturbhai patel admitted breaching the town and country planning act 1990 after he made major rooftop alterations to his property without permission and did not comply with a council enforcement notice requiring them to be removed .
the extension made room for a new staircase and an ensuite bedroom and could have added hundreds of thousands of pounds to the four-storey property .
the authority wanted to prevent patel , 54 , from profiting financially from the additional floor space created by the royal borough of kensington and chelsea in november 2012 .
