scotland yard is in discussion with the government over proposed changes to the law which could help increase the number of ethnic minorities on the met police force .
just 10 per cent of the met 's 32,000 officers are from ethnic minority backgrounds compared to 40 % of london 's overall population .
the government is considering a system similar to that used in northern ireland where one catholic officer was recruited for every protestant officer to bring proportional representation to the force .
