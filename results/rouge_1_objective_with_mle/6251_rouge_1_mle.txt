labour mps are said to be hatching a secret plot to stop the party brokering a coalition with nicola sturgeon 's snp .
labour mps say the possibility of forming an alliance with a party which wants to break up the uk is already alienating many of their core voters on both sides of the border .
labour mp john cryer , chairman of the plp , is understood to have told mr miliband 's aides that his mps will not tolerate a repeat of the situation .
