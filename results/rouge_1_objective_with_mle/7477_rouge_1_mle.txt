archaeologists will begin charting the site of the staffordshire model of the battle of messines , belgium , which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops from the war .
the model was planned to uncover the model built by german prisoners of war which long since has become covered by earth and foliage is set to start .
the ridge formed an anchor in the german front lines but the week-long offensive of infantry attack , aerial bombardment and heavy shelling resulted in an allied victory with four victoria crosses awarded to empire soldiers for bravery during the fight .
