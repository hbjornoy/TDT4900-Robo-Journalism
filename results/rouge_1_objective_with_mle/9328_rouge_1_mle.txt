new zealand 's east coast will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work .
the gangs have been involved in drug trafficking , alleged murder , and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace , not war .
it 's a very different kind of work than they 're used to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families .
