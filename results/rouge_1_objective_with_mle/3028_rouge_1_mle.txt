roman shilov , whose wife and the baby daughter live in brisbane , was detained by russian authorities on controversial charges of drug trafficking in july 2012 .
the australian and russian citizen has been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk , despite the australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport .
mr shilov had returned to moscow three years before his arrest to assist his father with his spice trade business which supplied up to 20 per cent of the country 's poppy seed market at the time .
