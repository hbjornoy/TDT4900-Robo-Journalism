the shooting occurred on sunday at a time when russian security forces are on high alert due to safety concerns about possible attacks on the winter olympics in sochi , thousands of miles to the west .
the gunman was detained at the cathedral of the resurrection of christ in yuzhno-sakhalinsk , after the shooting , the federal investigative committee said .
there was no immediate word on a motive in the attack , which comes just six days after a moscow teenager killed a teacher and held classmates hostage in russia .
