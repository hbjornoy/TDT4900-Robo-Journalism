students from sydney and london have developed an amphibious prosthetic limb that lets wearers run on sand and swim full speed in the sea .
the murr-ma limb has a split-toe design that helps a user balance on the uneven terrain of a beach and has studs that give a larger surface area when running on soft sand .
the limb also comes with ` fins ' that mean the wearer can transition to swimming easily .
