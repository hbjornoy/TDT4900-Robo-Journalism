hidden cameras in islington recorded the prank video dreamed up to promote ` ultimate b movie ' in the video .
the shark 's razor-sharp teeth , glassy dead eyes and immense cavernous mouth fooled most of the people in the shop - bar an old lady , who strokes its head as she walks past .
the stunt from special effects producers at syfy saw a team of four artists and animatronic wizards create the shark over two weeks .
