hull have been charged by the football association for failing to control their players in saturday 's goalless premier league clash against leicester on 14 march 2015 .
the charge appears to relate to an incident where a number of tigers players reacted furiously to alex bruce being booked by referee jon ross for a robust but ultimately fair challenge on riyad mahrez .
the incident came in the middle of a highly-charged period as michael dawson had been booked two minutes earlier for a challenge on jamie vardy .
