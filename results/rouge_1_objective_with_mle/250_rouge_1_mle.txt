superior court judge carl taylor in middletown , connecticut , denied requests made last month by attorneys for both cassandra and her mother , jackie fortin .
the judge ruled on wednesday she must remain in dcf custody until completing court-ordered chemotherapy for hodgkin 's lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , at connecticut children 's medical center in hartford .
the state supreme court then ruled against cassandra 's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions .
cassandra fortin was ordered for at least six months after doctors said the teen had an 85 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy .
