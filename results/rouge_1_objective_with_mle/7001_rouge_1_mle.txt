researchers in london have created a new technology that uses sound , such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop , to charge up mobile phones .
nokia worked with the qmul team to create an energy-harvesting prototype that could be used to charge a mobile phone using everyday background noise .
the invention was inspired by previous research at queen mary university of london -lrb- qmul -rrb- , which found playing pop and rock music improved the performance of solar cells .
