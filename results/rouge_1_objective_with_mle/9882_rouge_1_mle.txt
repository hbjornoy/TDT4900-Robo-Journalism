boxer curtis woodhouse was so incensed he offered a cash reward for the man 's address and drove to confront him on his doorstep .
the 32-year-old ex-birmingham city and hull city centre , who took up boxing at 26 , lost his english light welterweight crown to shayne singleton on a controversial points decision last week .
he was enraged when he was branded a ` disgrace ' , a ` waste of s **** ' and was urged to retire by sheffield-based user jimmyob88 , so woodhouse offered # 1,000 to anyone who could help him find him .
