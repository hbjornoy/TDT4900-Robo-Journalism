michael gove was demoted yesterday as david cameron 's election guru lynton crosby engineered a ruthless elevation of women and eurosceptics .
the education secretary , a hero for the tory right , paid the price for his ` toxic ' public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms .
mr gove was hailed as the most eurosceptic holder of the post since the second world war .
