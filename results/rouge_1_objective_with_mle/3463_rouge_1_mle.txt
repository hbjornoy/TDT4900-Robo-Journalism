toronto mayor rob ford ` appeared intoxicated ' and invited an unidentified woman into his office for an hour when he was closed for a public holiday just days before he entered rehab .
the city hall report said ford was ` slurring his words , red in the face , and sweating profusely ' when he asked a security guard to ` bring her up ' just before 8 p.m. on april 21 , easter monday .
the mayor 's brother doug ford has called the movements ` muscle spasms ' from lifting weights .
