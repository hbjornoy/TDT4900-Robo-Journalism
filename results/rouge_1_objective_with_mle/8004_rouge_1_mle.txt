professor george eleftheriades and michael selvanayagam tested a new approach to cloaking , by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field .
the radiated field cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object , rendering the object invisible to radar .
this is the set up of the lab where the boy wizard , or the cloaking device used by the kingons to make their ships invisible to another starship 's sensors .
the two researchers at the university of toronto have created an invisibility cloak that they say is thin and adaptive to different types and sizes of objects .
