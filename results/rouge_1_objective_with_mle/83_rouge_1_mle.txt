the 11-year-old terrier nearly lost an ear and suffered horrific bites during the fight at balmoral a week ago .
the fight is believed to have started after the queen 's six dogs were taken for a walk with the york family 's three norfolk terriers last sunday .
the queen owns three corgis , called monty , holly , willow , and three dorgis .
