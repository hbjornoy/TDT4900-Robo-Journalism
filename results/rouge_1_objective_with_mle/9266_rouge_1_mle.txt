a moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the propulsion system of a ferry .
the pair of stowaways , aged 29 and 31 , were caught this week after making the journey from tangier to southern spain , just inches from the engine of tangier to the port of tarifa , in the southern spanish province of cadiz .
police released the video of the failed attempt to warn people that they knew about the stunt , and that vessels are being checked each time as they start to come into port .
the moroccan man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed , pending being deported back
