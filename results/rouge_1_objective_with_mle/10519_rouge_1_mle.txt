pope francis has opened a barber shop for the homeless of rome to open in st peter 's square .
he was moved to act after a homeless man turned down an invitation to dinner at the vatican because he was embarrassed about his smell .
the salon service , paid for by donations and the sale of papal blessings , was the idea of the pope 's chief alms-giver , monsignor konrad krajewski .
