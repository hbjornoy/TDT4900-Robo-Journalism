eleven girls from one of brazil 's poorest favelas were treated to a debutante ball organised by local police and a team of volunteers .
the event took place at an upmarket tennis club in one of the wealthy districts close to the favela where they live .
the girls were given makeovers and dressed up in gowns that were loaned to them from nearby shops to provide a fairytale evening .
