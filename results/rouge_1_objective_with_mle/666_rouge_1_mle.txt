irina popova 's photo-essay entitled ` another family ' sparked national outrage when the portrayal of two st. petersburg 's addicts seemingly oblivious to their two-year-old girl , anfisa , was shared widely online .

she claims that the images are just that and do not represent the ability of pasha and lilya to raise awareness that bringing up a child is not an easy task .
