if the poll result was repeated in next year 's general election , it would see the tories lose 100 seats , the certain resignation of david cameron and the possibility of ed miliband in no10 .
the collapse could see ed miliband handed the keys to number 10 unless cameron does a deal with farage .
the tories and labour level pegging on 31 per cent , six ahead of ukip , with the lib dems on a paltry eight .
