michael oliver is an excellent referee at turf moor in diego costa .
the chelsea forward was sharp to intercept a backpass and knock the ball past tom heaton in the burnley goal .
costa was caught a distance from play and either guessed or was advised by his assistant that costa had been fouled and chelsea should have been awarded a penalty .
