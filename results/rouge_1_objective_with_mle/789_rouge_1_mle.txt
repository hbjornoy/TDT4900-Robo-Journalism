kieran conway , who is now a barrister in dublin , joined the ira in the last 1960s and claims that senior irish police officers colluded with the ira .
mr conway 's book alleges that members of the irish police force , an garda siochana , were also assisted by a top banker , a stock broker , a journalist as well as several mainstream politicians .
the police ombudsman of northern ireland found no evidence of collusion between the ira and the ruc over the murder of arthur rafferty .
