the car manufacturer today opened the doors of its dearborn development center in michigan to show what it takes to get a new vehicle on the road .
the car rolled down a track and slammed into a barrier at 30 miles an hour , with slow motion cameras and expensive dummies capturing every millisecond .
the faces of the crash test dummies are painted so analysts can see where they hit the airbag during a collision .
