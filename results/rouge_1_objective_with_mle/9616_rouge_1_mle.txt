daniel munns , a lincoln university graduate , travelled to the cambridgeshire station with a phantom 2 dji drone and a gopro camera .
he was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives in peteborough .
daniel was only testing his gopro camera and drone but was ecstatic with the final outcome of the united states from 1981 .
