colin furze , 34 , spent a week creating the strange gadget , which allow him to walk upside down along metal ceilings .
he then placed the transformer on a shoe shaped plate and clamped his foot to it .
mr furze built the magnet in the shoes using a microwave transformer , with one of the coils removed , and hooking it up to a car battery .
