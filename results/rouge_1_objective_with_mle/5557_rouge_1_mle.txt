hapa sushi has produced a menu for an ad campaign for the hapa sushi chain , which has four outlets in colorado .
it suggests that pakistani kush should be enjoyed with pakalolo shrimp and that purple rain is perhaps best suited to poke don .
the menu was dreamt up with the help of advertising agency tda boulder .
colorado and washington are the first two states with legalized recreational marijuana , and illinois , massachusetts , nevada and oregon will allow medical cannabis shops to open in 2014 .
