residents in a block of flats in colchester , essex , were told red tape means the binmen ca n't collect rubbish there when it 's too dark for them to see them for health and safety reasons .
the binmen have now refused to collect any more rubbish from the flats , saying they ca n't be seen to be breaking the rules .
residents from the block of the store are split and rats have already been spotted in the area just yards from people 's front doors .
