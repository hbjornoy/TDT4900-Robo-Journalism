the pensioner , who was travelling in first class on board the boeing 777-300 jet , was allegedly restrained by cabin crew until the plane was forced into the unplanned landing .
the pensioner was forced to divert to shannon airport in ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an air canada flight from germany to toronto that forced a diversion to the irish aviation authority 's -lrb- iaa -rrb- north atlantic communications service centre at ballygirreen in co clare , who advised to land at shannon airport .
the pilot has since been released without charge , and she will be undergoing a ` fit-to-fly - screening in the hope of continuing her journey
