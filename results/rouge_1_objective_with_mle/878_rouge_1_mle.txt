manchester city loanee john guidetti insists he would relish an old firm meeting with rangers in the league cup semi-finals .
the on-loan swede took his scoring streak to eight in as many games with two virtuoso free-kicks and a penalty in a 6-0 thrashing of 10-man partick thistle on wednesday night .
guidetti grabbed his third from the penalty spot after the swedish striker was fouled by abdul osman .
