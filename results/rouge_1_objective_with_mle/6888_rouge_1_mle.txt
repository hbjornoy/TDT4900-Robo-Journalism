committee on standards in public life said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the ` seven principles of public life ' in public office should abide by standards of selflessness , integrity , objectivity , accountability , honesty and leadership .
lord bew said he was concerned that only small numbers of mps ever turned up at induction courses which are currently offered on ethical standards .
the rules were drawn up following allegations that mps were receiving cash to ask questions in the house of commons .
