huma abedin and anthony weiner have been living on park avenue south ever since he sold his queens co-op during the 2011 sexting scandal in 2011 .
the flatiron apartment was being rented to them by democratic donor jack rosen , who is close with bill clinton , the former president who officiated weiner and abedin 's nuptials .
the former congressman and his political advisor wife have been spotted searching for a new apartment as their current apartment rent is too steep .
the couple are looking to move to a slightly cheaper apartment with their son jordan but are apparently staying in the neighborhood .
