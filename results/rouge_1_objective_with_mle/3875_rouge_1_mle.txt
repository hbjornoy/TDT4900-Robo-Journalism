the 15-mile thames tideway tunnel , estimated to cost nearly half of the 2012 olympics , will take 10 years to build and will be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the uk water industry .
it will stretch all the way from acton in west london , along the general path of the river thames , towards limehouse where it will veer north-east to abbey mills pumping station near stratford .
it is said to be needed to prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year .
