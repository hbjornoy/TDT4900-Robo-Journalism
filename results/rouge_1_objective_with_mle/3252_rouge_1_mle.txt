manchester united defender phil jones is expected to meet with the club 's medical staff on tuesday .
jones limped off in the 77th minute of monday 's 2-0 euro 2016 qualifying victory in switzerland due to what appeared to be hamstring problem .
no confirmation has been forthcoming from the football association on the matter and united will be eager to assess the 22-year-old when he arrives back in manchester .
