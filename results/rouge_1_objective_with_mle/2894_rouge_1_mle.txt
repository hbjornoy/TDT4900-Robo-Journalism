anthony douglas walked out of hmp hewell in worcestershire last wednesday .
it is understood a senior member of staff confused him with another prisoner who was due to be released and had the same surname .
anthony douglas , who is in his 20s , is thought to have spent time at the high-security psychiatric unit ashworth hospital in liverpool .
the mistake is the latest in a series of accidental prison breaks this year despite justice secretary chris grayling 's vow to tighten the rules and increase security to prevent any more escapes .
