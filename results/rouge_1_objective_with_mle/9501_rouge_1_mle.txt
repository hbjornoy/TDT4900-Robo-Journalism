artist maggi hambling begged to differ , describing 12 years a slave as ` frightfully boring ' and telling an audience of fine art students that she ` would n't mind a few slaves ' as she sat through the 134-minute movie .
the comment offended a black person in the audience and was branded a ` despicable racist rant ' by an equal rights group .
