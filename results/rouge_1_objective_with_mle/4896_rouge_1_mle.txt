peter schmeichel says manchester united 's failure to pick a settled back four will cost them in the long-run this season .
marcos rojo partnered chris smalling in the middle of the united defence for the 1-1 draw with chelsea on sunday and it was their eighth different pairing in nine games .
united have conceded 13 goals in their nine league games so far , and schmeichel believes de gea 's form is the only positive van gaal can take from his side 's defending .
