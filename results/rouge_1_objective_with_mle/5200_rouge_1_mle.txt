nathan ould , 39 , was sitting in his boat when the barb was cast towards him and pierced his cheek in a row over mackerel .
the attacker then fled with the rest of his angling equipment and left his victim needing medical treatment to remove the metal hook from his left cheek .
mr ould has described the moment the two-inch hook suddenly hit his face and believes he is lucky not to be blind .
