tara mcintyre , 24 , was left virtually wheelchair-bound after ben hagon 's high-powered mercedes sports car crashed into her at up to 75mph .
she had just popped out to the shops in her small ka when she was hit by the drunk-driver and suffered a fractured spine and pelvis .
hagon , who already had a conviction for drink-driving in 2003 , had taken prescription tranquilisers and was more than twice the legal alcohol limit when he got behind the wheel .
hagon was overtaking a line of cars on the a131 at high garrett , near braintree , essex .
