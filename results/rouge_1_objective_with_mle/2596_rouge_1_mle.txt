one mother wanted to stop her child from developing neurofibromatosis , which causes tumours to grow along the body 's nerves and can reduce a sufferer 's lifespan by up to 15 years .
the fertility watchdog has damned the incidents as ` grade a ' errors -- the rare and most severe type of screening is available only to women who are at high risk of passing on a serious genetic disorder .
