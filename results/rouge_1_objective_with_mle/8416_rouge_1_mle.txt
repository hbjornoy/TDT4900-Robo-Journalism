mercedes boss toto wolff has revealed the team may have to make ` an unpopular call ' for their drivers in light of ferrari 's revival this season .
wolff 's remark also comes in the wake of nico rosberg 's moaning over the team radio during sunday 's chinese grand prix about how slow team-mate lewis hamilton was driving .
wolff says he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race .
