parliament is poised to vote on whether a new form of ivf treatment , which uses dna from three parents , will become legally available to couples , making the prospect of genetically-modified humans imminent .
the procedure is designed to get rid of genetic mutations that can lead to blindness , epilepsy and other medical problems .
if politicians embrace the procedure , the law would be the first to allow pre-birth human dna modification .
