foreign chefs , bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in australia from july 1 .
the three professions have been added to the skilled occupation list which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa .
the move has been slammed by unions who say the government should be looking out for domestic workers instead of encouraging more overseas workers to come to australia .
