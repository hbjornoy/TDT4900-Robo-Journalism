scientists from the university of new south wales -lrb- unsw -rrb- showed for the first time that rats fed a diet of junk food can have a detrimental effect on the brain 's cognitive ability .
the animals found it more difficult to recognise specific places after their junk food diet and showed a lesser ability to notice when an object shifted to a new location .
the study suggests that obesity can trigger rapid changes in the brain .
