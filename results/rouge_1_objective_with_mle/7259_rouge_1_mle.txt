radio 4 's today interviewer john humphrys accused his employer of being ` soft ' , ` complacent ' and ` institutionally nervous ' when it came to tackling the story or questioning multiculturalism .
he said the bbc coverage was ` nonsense ' and had been ` hyperbolic ' and now humphrys , 71 , has told the sunday times magazine that the corporation is facing an ` existential crisis greater than it 's ever been ' because he failed to challenge labour 's decision to allow migrants from poland and hungary to work in britain from 2004 .
