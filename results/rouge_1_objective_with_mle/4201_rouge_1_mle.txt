researchers found italy 's lake garda - a popular holiday destination for families and those keen on water sports such as windsurfing - is contaminated with potentially hazardous tiny microplastics .
scientists from the university of bayreuth in germany believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain through a wide range of freshwater invertebrates .
scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated .
