the state supreme court on monday sent the matter back to lawrence county juvenile court to hold a hearing about the evidence used to convict jordan brown of the february 2009 shotgun killing of 26-year-old kenzie hook and her unborn son at their home near wampum .
brown was arrested for the shooting murder of his father 's fiancee and unborn baby .
brown 's attorneys will file a motion seeking a new trial , arguing that his prior adjudication of delinquency in juvenile court went against the weight of the evidence .
