tamimul islam is believed to have been by himself for up to an hour .
he wanted to go home rather than back to st hilda 's primary in oldham , greater manchester , which he had only attended for a few days .
tamimul 's father , khairul islam , said : ` people should have been watching him and guarding the main entrance to make sure that no child could have walked into a main road by himself and the school could n't explain what happened '
