william vahey , 64 , is said to have held a ` cookie race ' at bedtime in which children as young as ten were on a usb memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008 .
the revelations prompted ` complete shock ' in natalie salmon , 23 , who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in venezuela .
she said she remembered vahey as being a ` nice , shy sort of guy ' , but her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the possibility they were his victims .
