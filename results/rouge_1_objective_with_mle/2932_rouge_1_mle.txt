owners of william welsummer , or willy , have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise , after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early .
they say they have never raised any problems with the bird to try and soundproof willie 's pen to stop noise complaints .
willy has been the subject of complaints by simon bee because of his regular 4am calls at the farm in eyam .
