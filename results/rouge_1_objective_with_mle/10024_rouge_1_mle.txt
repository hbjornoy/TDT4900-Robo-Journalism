dog race is covered in barren gravel , forcing iditarod organizers to move the start further north where there is snow and ice .
the race 's chief executive officer , stan hooley , called the conditions ` pretty miserable ' and last year was taken out by a rescue helicopter after making it through the dalzell gorge only to hit his head on a tree stump in the farewell burn .
this year 's race will feature 78 mushers , including six former champions and 20 rookies .
