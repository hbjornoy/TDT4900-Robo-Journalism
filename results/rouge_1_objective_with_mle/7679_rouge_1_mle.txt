miranda gibson , 31 , climbed down from the 100ft tall , 400-year-old eucalyptus tree in tazmania to a hero 's welcome , as the fire raged just two kilometres away .
she was an australian record for a tree protest in the styx valley , 60 miles north west of hobart , that she had missed a close friend of hers becoming pregnant and having the baby .
the fire is only about two kilometres from where she and her conservation group still threatened learned ancient trees in the valley were due to be felled by logging companies .
