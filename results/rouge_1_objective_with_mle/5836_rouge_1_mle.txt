amit mirchandani , a creative director at indian creative agency lucid design , helped come up with the design because he wanted to make a full-size but compact carrying bike .
the chain is different to most bikes in that it uses a rubber belt drive system reinforced with carbon , while to brake you simply stop pedalling .
the result is the kit bike - designed to take out the awkward nature of fold-up bikes .
