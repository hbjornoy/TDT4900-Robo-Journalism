phil jones limped out of england 's euro 2016 qualifier against switzerland in basel on monday night .
louis van gaal has confirmed that phil jones could be out of action for between three weeks and a month with a hamstring strain .
the only good news is that michael carrick is running again and carrick has started running on grass after eight weeks out with ankle ligament damage .
the injury list is so long that van gaal turned up at his friday press conference with a piece of paper .
