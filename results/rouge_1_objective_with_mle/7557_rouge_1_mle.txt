the ` congratulations ' email was intended for a small group of new students who had already been offered a place at the university of st andrews .
the university , where prince william and kate middleton met as students , sent a second email apologising for the mix-up 30 minutes later .
it blamed the error on ` human error compounded by technology ' and said it was sorry for any disappointment caused by technology .
