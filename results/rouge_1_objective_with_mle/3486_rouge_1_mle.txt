teddy bears parachuting over a residential area in minsk , belarus on july 4 .
it all stems from a stunt by a swedish pr which parachuted 800 teddy bears into belarus last month .
the company chartered a light aircraft which invaded belarussian airspace to drop the bears , all of which highlighted the lack of human rights in the former soviet state .
the president of belarus , alexander lukashenko , has sacked senior members of his staff over the teddy bear incident and is now taking his fury out on sweden .
