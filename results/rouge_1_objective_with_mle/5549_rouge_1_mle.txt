traffic had started to build up on the m58 around switch island on merseyside .
but a renault driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the mercedes from advancing any further .
the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past .
the pair can be seen pointing and shouting at each other but despite their argument , neither driver lets up .
