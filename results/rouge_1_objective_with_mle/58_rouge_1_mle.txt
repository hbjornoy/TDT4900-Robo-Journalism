images from the 1900s show british climbers scaling some of britain 's highest peaks - with their bare hands and no protective equipment .
the death-defying pictures were taken in the early 1900s - long before the days of gore-tex , safety ropes , spikes , clips and high-strength kevlar cables .
the daredevils had no protective clothing other than woolly socks and flat caps - forming human chains to haul themselves over rocks and ridges .
