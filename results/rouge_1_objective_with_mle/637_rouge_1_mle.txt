the historic grade ii listed fleece hotel in richmond , yorkshire , has gone up for sale for the guide price of # 250,000 pounds after it closed suddenly earlier this month .
the pub was briefly renamed tanya 's charms in honour of local resident tanya robinson , now tanya bardsley .
the new owners will have to spend some time and hard work bringing the accommodation up to modern standards , with the hotel rooms not thought to have been used for over 20 years .
