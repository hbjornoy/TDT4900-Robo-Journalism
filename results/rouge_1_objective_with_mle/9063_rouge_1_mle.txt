gary neville and jamie carragher slammed kevin mirallas after the everton midfielder refused to let leighton baines take a penalty against west brom .
the belgian stepped up to take the penalty as a ` despicable breach of team orders , ' neville said on sky sports during the 0-0 draw at goodison park on monday night .
mirallas ignored baines and team-mates romelu lukaku and steven naismith , who both tried to reason with the belgian , before firing his effort from 12 yards wide via the base of the left-hand post .
