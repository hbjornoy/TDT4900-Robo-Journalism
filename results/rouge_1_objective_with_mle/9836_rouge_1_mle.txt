families in torquay , devon , visited what they thought was a golden stretch of shoreline to relax in the glorious sunshine .
they were forced to clear away a carpet of seaweed to relax on the bright green beach .
torbay council said the occurrence is a natural phenomenon , cleans the beach on a rota and it just so happened that preston had n't been scheduled for a clean-up that day .
