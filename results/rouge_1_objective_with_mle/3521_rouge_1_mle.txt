the town council has been forced to compromise with a new premier inn which called for the chimes of the memorial to be restricted in order to stop guests being disturbed .
the bell will continue to do so despite attempts from the premier inn to shut it down at 8pm , a request rejected by the council of the historic town , which lies 10 miles north-east of stoke-on-trent .
premier inn has spent # 6.5 million on the hotel on ashbourne road and brought 30 jobs to the town .
