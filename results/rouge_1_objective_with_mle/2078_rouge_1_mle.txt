the butte de warlencourt was once a symbol of the bloody battle of the somme - fiercely fought over by british and german forces .
the butte will be restored to its former glory in time for the centenary of the great war , next year .
the western front association bought the site 23 years ago from a local farmer for # 7,500 in a bid to preserve it for future generations .
