airasia x ` airasia ' airline had been promoting their new route for months , promising to fly passengers directly from melbourne to bali after a december 26 launch .
they sent out frantic texts on christmas day to passengers , informing them that flights from boxing day onwards were not cancelled , but their expected travel time on their new flights was now doubled from five-and-a-half hours to a lengthy 13 hours .
the commuters were informed they would now stop over at kuala lumpur , meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned .
