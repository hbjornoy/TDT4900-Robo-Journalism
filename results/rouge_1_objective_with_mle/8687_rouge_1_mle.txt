glenn o'neill and his wife cara have opted to stay away from other people to help their daughter eliza , five , who has the rare metabolism disorder , sanfilippo syndrome .
they are determined to make sure she does not miss out - recently eliza 's school held a frozen-themed dance , but as the five-year-old could not attend , her family recreated the dance at their home .
the family are still anxiously waiting for the outcome of a clinical trial they have been raising funds for - so far $ 2.2 million has been donated to the foundation .
