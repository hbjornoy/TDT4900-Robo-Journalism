pop star rihanna spent a weekend at the beach in thailand to visit the island of phuket , where she befriended some local wildlife .
she posted a link on twitter to an instagram photo that showed her in sunglasses snuggling up to a furry primate called the slow loris , and tweeted friday : ` it is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies .
if someone hears that the police are coming their way , there will be a person who calls the touts and tells them to move , ' he said .
