coachella valley high school has agreed to redesign its arab mascot .
the arab mascot has existed since the 1920s and is a nod to the desert region 's reliance on date farming .
the mascot evolved from a turban-wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and traditional head covering .
it came under fire last november when the american-arab anti-discrimination committee sent a letter to the school district complaining that the mascot was stereotypical .
