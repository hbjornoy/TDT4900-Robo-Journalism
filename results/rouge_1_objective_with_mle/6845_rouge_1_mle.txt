the court-appointed guardian , maria schimer , who is also a registered nurse , has dropped her attempt to force amish girl , sarah hershberger , 11 , to have chemotherapy treatment .
the move filed in court friday will likely bring an end to a month 's - long fight between sarah hershberger 's family and a hospital that began when her parents decided to halt the treatments because she does n't know where sarah is now and it has become impossible to monitor her health or make any medical decisions .
