manchester united great paul scholes has delivered a grim assessment of his old club .
scholes was outclassed by david silva , fernandinho and yaya toure at old trafford on tuesday night as united slumped to a humiliating 3-0 defeat in the manchester derby in front of their own fans .
the midfielder was also lucky to escape a red card when referee michael oliver only booked him for blatantly thrusting a forearm into the face of manchester city defender pablo zabaleta .
