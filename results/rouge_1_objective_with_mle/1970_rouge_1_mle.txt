scientists have found that humidity in different areas may have influenced the way languages evolved there .
they found languages with complex tones - those that use one or more contrasting tones to give meaning to words like cantonese - tend to occur in humid regions of the world .
the climate may have led to the evolution of the modern non-tonal languages that was spoken 6,000 years ago by people living on the relatively dry pontic steppe north of the black sea .
this is because inhaling dry air can dehydrate the vocal cords and make them less elastic , making it harder to produce complex tones in words .
