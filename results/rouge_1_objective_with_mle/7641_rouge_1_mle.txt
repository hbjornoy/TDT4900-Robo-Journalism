martin tatta , 32 , grew up around horses on a ranch in san antonio de areco , a province of buenos aires in argentina , where he can sit on her tummy .
the self-taught horse tamer can sit under her hooves , do handstands on her neck and even persuade her to lie on her side so he can use her as a pillow .
the ranch owners spotted his close bond with the horses as a child and encouraged him to practise the shows he now gives to thousands of tourists from all over the world .
