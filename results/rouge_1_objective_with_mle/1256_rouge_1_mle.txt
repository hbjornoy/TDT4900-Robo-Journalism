nearly half of parents have not taught their children how to dial 999 .
the survey of 757 parents was carried out by mumsnet , the uk 's largest internet community for parents .
campaigners say their children were not mature enough to learn the difference between 999 and america 's 911 .
the mumsnet website www.999forkids.com is now urging parents to build on their children 's interests in the emergency services and characters like fireman sam to educate them about making an emergency call .
