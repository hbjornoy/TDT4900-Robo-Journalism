founder tom walkinshaw told mailonline that he was inspired to launch the company after being rejected for a job at local company , clyde space .
this has all been made possible by glasgow-based start-up alba orbital who has recently begun creating the building blocks for tiny satellites named ` pocketqubes ' the smaller size of walkinshaw 's pocketqube has driven down the cost of launch , and elements of a pocketqube can be stacked up to create a larger satellite .
