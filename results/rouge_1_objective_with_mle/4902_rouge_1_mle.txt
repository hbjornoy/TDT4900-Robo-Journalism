former president george w. bush said in a rare tv interview broadcast sunday morning that he was shocked to learn iraqi dictator saddam hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive u.s. invasion .
the younger bush kept the book project close to his vest for years to bill clinton in 1992 .
the former president will ship on tuesday .
the interview is already being interpreted on twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at president barack obama , whose ` red line ' ultimatums leveled at syria and iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless .
