berahino was in roy hodgson 's squad for the matches against slovenia and scotland last november but did not feature and will instead play for gareth southgate 's junior side against the czech republic and germany at the end of this month .
baggies boss tony pulis has insisted that berahino 's call-up to the england under-21s side is a ` big honour in itself ' after the west bromwich albion striker missed out on a senior call-up .
berahino has scored 26 goals in all competitions for spurs so far this season .
