victor valdes has travelled to monaco in a bid to prove his fitness ahead of a free transfer after barcelona released the goalkeeper at the end of last season .
the 32-year-old is currently out with a serious knee injury that will almost certainly keep him out for months .
the former sporting lisbon coach appeared to have abandoned plans to sign the spain international .
the big-spending ligue 1 side are keen to measure the extent of the problem and whether valdes is still a viable long-term option .
