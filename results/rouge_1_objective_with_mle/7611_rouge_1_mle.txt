fanta has gotten rid of a fanta advertisement that referred to the 1940s , the time period in which the drink was first produced in germany .
fanta was created by the soda company 's employees , because there were limited supplies available to produce coke .
the advertisement was in honor of fanta 's 75th anniversary and promoted a new drink recipe .
