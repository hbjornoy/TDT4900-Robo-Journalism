research was carried out by tasking flies with picking between two similar odours .
the researchers asked fruit flies to distinguish between ever closer concentrations of an odour they were trained to avoid .
the flies acted quickly to move to the end of a chamber furthest away from the strongest smell .
scientists admitted to being surprised by the discovery , which indicates that a gene called foxp was involved in the decision-making process in the fly 's brain .
