andy kovac spotted a buck wandering around his backyard in pittsburgh , pa. on wednesday sporting a very interesting hat .
the deer had a basketball stuck between its antlers but did n't contact the deer 's ability to eat food .
the ball is already deflating so it wo n't be stuck in this buck 's antlers for too long .
