beers of different flavours would have been brewed from malted barley and fermented with an alcoholic content of around 5 per cent - much the same as a modern day beer .
a team of archaeologists have been toasting the discovery of a bronze age ` microbrewery ' in western cyprus .
the discovery was found at one end of a 50 metre square courtyard with a plastered floor .
