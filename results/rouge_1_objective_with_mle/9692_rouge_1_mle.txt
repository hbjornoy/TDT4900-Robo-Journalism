the bbc may reconsider their decision to name part of their london headquarters after the late dj john peel amid claims he had an affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl .
mrs nevin says she was ` in awe ' of the radio 1 dj , then 30 , and had a ` traumatic ' abortion at a black sabbath concert in the summer of 1969 .
she said she was pregnant shortly after he had been suffering from a venereal disease .
