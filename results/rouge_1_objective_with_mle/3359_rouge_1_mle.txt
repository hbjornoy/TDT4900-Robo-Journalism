cornelius gurlitt , 80 , said he wants the # 1billion of art treasures taken from his flat by german customs officials returned to him -- despite the fact at least some of the haul is nazi loot strong-armed from jewish people at knock-down prices .
the art was raided by customs officials who had stopped him in 2010 on a train back from switzerland with 9,000 euros in cash and empty envelopes stamped with the name of a swiss bank .
