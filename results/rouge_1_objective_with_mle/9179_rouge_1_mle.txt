st john 's college student lucan battison was subsequently suspended by principal paul melloy last month .
mr bates said lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the catholic college three years ago .
the suspension was cleared on the basis that the 16-year-old returned to the high court at wellington for a judicial review sought after by his father troy battison and lucan has not returned to school .
