melony gallagher , a cat owner from plymouth , was found on christmas day with her g-paws tracker hinting at a magical ride .
she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of plymouth in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph .
she was left with only one conclusion to draw - that suki had hitched a ride on his sleigh .
the makers of g-paws were not in the mood for a supernatural journey on the nonplussed moggy .
