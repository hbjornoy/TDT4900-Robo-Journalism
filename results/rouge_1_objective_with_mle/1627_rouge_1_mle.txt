labour peer lord foulkes , a former mp in scotland , broke ranks last night to insist mr miliband should rule out any deal with the rampant snp .
it was described as a ` cdu-csu scenario ' , mirroring a deal between angela merkel 's christian democrats with the christian social union in the german state of bavaria .
the cdu does not stand candidates in bavaria in exchange for support in germany 's bundestag .
