fabio borini believes he could forge a good partnership with fellow italian mario balotelli .
balotelli has yet to find his form with just one goal , against bulgarian minnows ludogorets , in eight matches and was dropped for last weekend 's win over west brom .
the 23-year-old has shared the field with balotelli for just 98 minutes but is confident they could bring out the best in each other .
