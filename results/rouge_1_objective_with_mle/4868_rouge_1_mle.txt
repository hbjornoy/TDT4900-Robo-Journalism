arthur reid , 90 , has popped into the griffin pub almost every day at 3pm since turning 18 to enjoy a pint or two of his beloved courage bitter .
he has his own special glass behind the bar and now an engraved gold plaque has been placed on the back of his favourite chair to mark his 90th birthday .
