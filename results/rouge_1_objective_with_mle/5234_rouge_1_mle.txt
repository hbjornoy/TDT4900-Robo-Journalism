connor wickham is considering a move abroad to try and recapture the ` golden boy tag ' that saw him tipped at one time to become the best english striker since wayne rooney .
the england under-21 striker has scored only 10 goals in 60 games in three seasons for the blackcats and spent time on loan to sheffield wednesday .
wickham was part of the sunderland team humiliated 8-0 in their last away game at crystal palace on monday night .
