jane caro made the remarks in a special festival of dangerous ideas panel on monday night .
she said her comments on abc tv 's q&a on monday were not aimed at modern wives , but she was speaking about the institution of marriage in the past .
she has since adamantly stood by her comments while trying to clarify that she was not saying people 's ` grandmothers ' are prostitutes .
