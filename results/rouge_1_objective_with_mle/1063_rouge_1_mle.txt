sharday rose , 24 , died in july 2011 after fleeing about a block and a half from officers .
the medical examiner 's office initially classified the death as natural , saying he died of sickle cell crisis - he had the genetic marker for sickle cell but not the disease itself .
the u.s. department of justice and fbi investigated but could not find enough evidence to support charging the officers involved with depriving a person 's rights under the color of law .
