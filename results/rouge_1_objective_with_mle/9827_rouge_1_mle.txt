american pilot roland wolfe crashed his british spitfire into a peat bog in ireland during world war two , few thought it would ever be seen again .
the pilot from nebraska had been stripped of his u.s. citizenship after agreeing to fight for the british because the americans had not yet joined the war .
the british government returned wolfe to the most relaxed of ` prison ' camps in ireland where he was kept for a further two years .
the spitfire was the first of 20 made with a donation from a canadian millionaire called willard garfield who wanted to support the allies in the battle of britain with a # 100,000 donation .
