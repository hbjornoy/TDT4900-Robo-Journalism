geoff inskip , chief executive of the west midlands transport authority , called on the government to take the m6 toll road out of private hands to ease congestion around britain 's second largest city .
it was hoped the 27 mile stretch would relieve traffic congestion around the next 15 years , transport chief geoff inskip says .
the # 900m road should be nationalised rather than expanding the original m6 to cope with the projected 25 per cent increase in traffic .
