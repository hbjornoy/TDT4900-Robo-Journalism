alec baldwin took time out of filming a movie in hawaii to tell his side of the story and place at least a portion of the blame on gay rights advocates who he argues used him as a scapegoat .
the scandal erupted earlier this month when he was videotaped using a homophobic slur towards a photographer outside of his apartment .
he has since apologized for saying the first half of the slur , claiming he did not know that it was derogative towards homosexuals .
