mohammadullah khan , 20 , who came to britain from afghanistan , assaulted a 26-year-old french woman as she got off a night bus in maida vale , west london , in july last year .
khan 's case cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds after the case had to be adjourned six times as the defendant tried to change his plea and refused to co-operate with either the probation service or his own legal team .
the case was delayed on a third occasion when he tried to retract the victim 's bottom and kiss her and claimed his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams .
