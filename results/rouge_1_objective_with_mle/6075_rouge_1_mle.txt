david miliband refused to knife brother david in the labour leadership race led to a worse deterioration in their relationship than he expected .
mr miliband stood against his brother , the former foreign secretary who had been favourite to succeed gordon brown in 2010 , and clinched an unexpected victory thanks to the backing of trade union leaders .
ed miliband said their relationship was a ` massive amount better than it was ' but declined to speculate about whether his brother would ever take a job in a future labour government .
