the chateau d'aubiry really is a fairy-tale home and is attracting the attention of billionaire moguls and euromillions lottery winners .
the chateau , located on the les aspres mountain chain in the pyrenees close to the town of perpignan , boasts 15 bedrooms , a chapel , vineyards , a wine cellar and more than 12 acres of sprawling yet immaculately kept gardens .
the beautiful 19th century masterpiece looks nothing like disney 's interpretation of a castle fit for a princess .
