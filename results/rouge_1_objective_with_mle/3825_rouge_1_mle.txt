the russian dolls depict elton john , stephen fry , george michael , graham norton and tom daley are hand-crafted by paul baker and staff at 3d studios in london .
the dolls ' creators had originally planned to make a tiny version of the russian president vladimir putin into the smallest doll .
the campaigners say they are happier to have included daley over putin , because the dolls are now a celebration of ` great british gays '
