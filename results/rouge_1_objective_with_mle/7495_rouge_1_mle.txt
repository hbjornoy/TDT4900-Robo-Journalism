ted cruz and his family will be the latest to use the system , signing up for medical insurance coverage through the obamacare law 's government-run marketplaces .
cruz 's wife heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at goldman sachs to campaign with him and lost her employer-funded plan in the process .
the exchanges , created by obamacare law , are designed to be state-specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage .
