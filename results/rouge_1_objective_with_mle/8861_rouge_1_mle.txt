pierre le guennec , 75 , and wife danielle , 72 , from mouans sartoux , near cannes , claim the artist 's wife jacqueline gave them the treasure trove of works while mr le guennec was working at picasso 's house as an electrician in the 1970s .
the couple then kept the hugely valuable horde of art stashed in their garage in southern france for 40 years .
they were arrested after they took a suitcase crammed with canvases to the painter 's heirs in 2010 to have them authenticated .
