the obama administration announced on tuesday that it intends to change the way americans learn about natural disasters and other major emergencies during radio and tv broadcasts .
it can take up to 10 minutes for every radio , tv , cable and satellite provider to blare its alert .
the fcc 's plan could also be used to warn americans about terror attacks and major natural disasters .
the federal communications commission has filed public notice of a rule change that would bypass the daisy-chain entirely .
