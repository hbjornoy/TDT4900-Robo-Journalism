president barack obama has left india for saudi arabia without inking a climate deal that formed much of the basis for his second trip to the subcontinent .
the hindustan times reported on tuesday that india has refused to embrace the idea of a ` peaking year ' for greenhouse gas emissions -- a designated year after which emissions levels would have to start decreasing .
china is the world 's fourth-biggest carbon emitter .
china agreed to that sort of framework last year , but indian officials now see being lumped in with beijing as a negative thing .
