michael sam from the practice squad tuesday , another setback as the nfl 's first ever openly gay player tries to make an active roster during the regular season for the first time .
sam spent seven weeks with the cowboys after signing to their practice squad on sept. 3 , four days after he was among the final cuts by the st. louis rams at the end of the preseason .
the cowboys are among the league 's worst in sacks but have been getting solid production with a rotation in the front four of a defense exceeding expectations .
