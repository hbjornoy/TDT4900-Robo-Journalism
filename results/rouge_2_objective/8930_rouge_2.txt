ryan hall had a last-minute try disallowed as australia beat england 16-12 in the four nations on sunday .
the kangaroos were clinging to a 16-12 lead when hall attempted to touch down ahead of full-back greg inglis with 46 seconds left .
hall chased down a grubber kick from liam farrell and felt he chased down the ball ahead of ryan inglis with referee gerard sutton not giving a try , his brother bernard , the video official , needed ` sufficient evidence ' hall had failed to find downward pressure , which left australia celebrating a face-saving victory at melbourne 's aami park .
