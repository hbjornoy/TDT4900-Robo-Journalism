lindsay lohan had been banned from the prestigious chateau marmont hotel for reportedly not paying a $ 46,000 bill .
but it seems the hotel may have finally sorted out their differences with the 26-year-old actress making a return on thursday night .
lindsay - sporting new red hair extensions - was seen sneaking out of the hotel , which is also famous for its nightclub , in the early hours of friday morning .
the hotel 's general manager philip pavel wrote a letter to lindsay in july , informing her that she was no longer welcome in chateau marmont .
