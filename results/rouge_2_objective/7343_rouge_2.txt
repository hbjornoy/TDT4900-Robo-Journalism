experts claim to have unravelled the evolutionary changes needed for ancient lobe-finned fish to turn underwater pectoral fins into strong , bony structures .
scientists were unsure exactly how this happened , but the latest research shows that certain species of fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists , fingers , ankles and toes of tetrapods are remarkably similar .
the experts claim that genetic ` switches ' -lrb- shown in green -rrb- in transgenic fish fins , meaning it has the potential to evolve into fingers and wrists .
