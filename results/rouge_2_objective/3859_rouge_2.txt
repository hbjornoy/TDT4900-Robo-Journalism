geologists detected 342 tremors with epicentres within 150 metres -lrb- 492 feet -rrb- of a cement plant in ghigiano , umbria in northern italy , a location that is not volcanically active yet was being hit with mysterious rumbles .
they had attributed the vibrations to movements of magma bubbling near the surface of the earth 's crust beneath the country , despite occurring in areas that were detected by italy 's extensive network of seismic sensors in recent years .
italy is one of the largest producers of cement in europe and has at least 57 full cycle plants and dozens more processing plants .
