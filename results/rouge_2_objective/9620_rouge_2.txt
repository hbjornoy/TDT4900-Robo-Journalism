dr karen halnon , 52 , who wrote her phd thesis on hysterical women , was arrested on board the plane for disorderly conduct as it sat on the tarmac at miami international airport on saturday .
she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after the flight had landed - but stubbed it out and thrust the butt into a seat pocket when flight attendants came over .
she then pointed at the man in a seat next to her when challenged over her behavior - before launching into a pro-communist rant attacking the united states for applying economic sanctions on venezuela .
she is an expert on capitalism , latin america and mad women .
