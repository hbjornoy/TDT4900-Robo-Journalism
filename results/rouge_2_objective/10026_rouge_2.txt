pop francis married 20 couples today , several with children out of wedlock , in the latest demonstration of his more laissez-faire attitude to catholic teaching .
the last time a pope performed a marriage was st john paul ii , who wed 16 people at a mass to mark the jubilee for families in october 2000 .
the pope believes the church must end its obsession with teachings on abortion , contraception and homosexuality , and become more merciful or risk collapsing ` like a house of cards ' francis , the first non-european pope in 1,300 years , has shown extreme tolerance in relation to subjects traditionally taboo in the church .
