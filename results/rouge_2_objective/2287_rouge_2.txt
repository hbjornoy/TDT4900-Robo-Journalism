james allan will not be remembered as a criminal mastermind .
in what can only be described as a farcical raid on a corner shop , he failed to ensure he had a foolproof disguise and a meticulously planned gateway .
allan 's embarrassing catalogue of errors started shortly after he burst into martin 's newsagent in full view of the shop 's cctv camera .
allan was jailed for three years for this offence last month .
