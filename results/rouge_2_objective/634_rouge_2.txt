staff at the nervous dog coffee bar in stow , ohio , announced they would hold a food-drive for the man this week rather than file a police report against him .
surveillance footage from the store shows the stranger order a coffee from a young barista , then when her back is turned , dip his hand into the tip jar and stuff as much cash as possible into his pocket .
the coffee shop posted the surveillance tape on its facebook page , with the words : ` we figured anyone desperate enough to steal a few bucks from a kid working her way through college , is likely pretty hungry '
