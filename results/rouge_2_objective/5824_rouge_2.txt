rolf harris has spent his first night in a london jail as child advocates in australia criticised the sex offender 's sentence as too lenient .
the 84-year-old was immediately sent to wandsworth prison in south-west london after being sentenced to five years and nine months ' jail for a string of indecent assaults against four girls in the uk .
he will only have to serve half that sentence , meaning he will be released in less than three years .
