astronomers have captured four images of the same exploding star nine billion light years away as it performed an incredible cosmic illusion .
the hubble telescope snapped the surprising multiple images with the help of a galaxy cluster that acted as a natural magnifying lens .
the galaxy and the galaxy cluster are acting like a giant cosmic lens , bending and magnifying light from the supernova behind them .
the supernova could be seen because its light took different paths around the cluster located between the exploded star and the earth-orbiting telescope .
