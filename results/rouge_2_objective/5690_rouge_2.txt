photographer matt molloy snapped a range of scenes including sunsets and bright skies in the middle of the day .
mr molloy , of ontario , canada , said one of the pictures was put together using hundreds of photos , and that he had used the same technique of overlapped multiple exposure in the past for star trails .
he said : ` sunsets seem to work well , as the lighting constantly gets darker .
a midday time-lapse can get messy , but they can be fun too '
