jose mourinho has responded to a six-year-old aston villa fan 's written request to manage his struggling side .
young villa fan jude branson took pen to paper to make the plea last week , before paul lambert was sacked following tuesday 's 2-0 defeat by hull city , and the chelsea manager has now replied by sending him an autograph .
chelsea boss jose mourinho had the good grace to send the youngster an autographed picture of himself and not a contract to become the next manager at villa park .
paul lambert is the front-runner to replace lambert and was also favourite for the qpr job .
