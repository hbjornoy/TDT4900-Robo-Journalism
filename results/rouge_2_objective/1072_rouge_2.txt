scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans .
a study of fossils of homo erectus , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully .
the above skeletons of erectus were reconstructed from fossils that the researchers used in their study .
this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey .
