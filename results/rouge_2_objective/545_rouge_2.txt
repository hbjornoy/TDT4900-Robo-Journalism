bottlenose dolphin has been seen 50 miles inland along a tidal river .
the bottlenose dolphin - the most common breed spotted in british waters - has ventured up the bristol channel and into the river severn .
experts say it is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further .
