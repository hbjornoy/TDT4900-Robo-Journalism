new study has revealed that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise .
during one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5 ft -lrb- 2 metres -rrb- in just 100 years .
the results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in antarctic 's and reflect predictions for the region 's future .
