officials in his hometown hailey , idaho , canceled a homecoming celebration for the american prisoner of war .
many in hailey suspect the celebration was also canned because of a massive backlash , both national and local , over reports that bergdahl deserted his post in afghanistan before he was captured .
bergdahl has told military officials that he was kept locked in a shark cage in total darkness for weeks at a time and tortured as punishment for twice trying to escape his taliban captors .
officials cited several death threats that mr and mrs bergdahl have received from people furious about the deal that saw him released from captivity .
