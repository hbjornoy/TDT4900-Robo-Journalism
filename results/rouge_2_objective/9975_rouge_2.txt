hannah gorsegner from middletown , new jersey , took the brave decision because she wanted to show her support for five-year-old sister , natalie , who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in august 2012 and is now in remission .
the two sisters wore matching dresses to the event .
the shaving took place last wednesday during a shave for a cure event held by the arms wide open childhood cancer foundation at the new york stock exchange .
the event raised over $ 350,000 for childhood cancer , and hannah donated her red hair to wigs for kids .
