an ad campaign launched earlier this month by the mta features humorous signs displaying proper subway etiquette etiquette for commuters .
signs show an illustration of commuters using the subway car as their personal powder room .
the mta has said that 2,600 subway cars will have the ads and they will create signs for the long island railroad and metro-north railroad as well .
