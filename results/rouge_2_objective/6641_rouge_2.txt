ray green says he was misled by the thomas cook brochure for the resort which offered no warning that regular parties with lasers and loud music , with revellers bused in from around the area , were held at the resort .
ray green , 52 , received # 250 compensation in vouchers from thomas cook after his supposed-to-be peaceful wintersun break to an el gouna resort was ruined by a pool party .
mr green also complained to the holiday company about the room he was given because it was too far from the main area of the hotel .
