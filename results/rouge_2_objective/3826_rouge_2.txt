education secretary michael gove said the tests have failed to prepare a generation of pupils for the world of work -- the same argument the education secretary has used to justify a schools revolution .
the institute of directors , the british chambers of commerce and the federation of small businesses have now caused a fierce row in the coalition as mr gove had not discussed them with the liberal democrats .
education secretary kevin brennan said he will publish a consultation document in mid-july setting out plans to scrap gcses and replace them with ` world class exams '
