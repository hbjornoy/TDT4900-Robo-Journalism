manchester united 's adnan januzaj has had his first cap for belgium taken away after fifa wiped last month 's 5-1 win over luxembourg from the official records .
coach marc wilmots made seven substitutions during the may 26 world cup warm-up in genk - one more than the quota permitted by world football 's governing body .
the decision means that chelsea striker romelu lukaku 's hat-trick in the match has been erased , while back-up goalkeeper sammy bossut also loses his cap .
