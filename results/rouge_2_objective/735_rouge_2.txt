david cameron was accused yesterday of signing britain up to a blueprint for a euro army .
the plans appear to duplicate the role of the nato alliance , which tories have traditionally credited with sole responsibility for european defence co-operation at a summit in brussels that will force britain to consult fellow eu nations over defence planning .
the communique issued at the end of the summit also featured calls for a co-ordinated policy to boost development of defence technology across europe .
