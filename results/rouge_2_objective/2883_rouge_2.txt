thousands of women who have gone through early menopause could be offered new hope by a pioneering fertility treatment .
the technique , which reawakens ` sleeping eggs ' , has allowed a woman who went through the menopause at the age of 25 to give birth to a healthy baby boy .
experts described the work as a ` real breakthrough ' but cautioned that it has so far only been tried out on a small number of women .
