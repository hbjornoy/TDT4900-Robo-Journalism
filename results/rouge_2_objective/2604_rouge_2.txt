sir bernard hogan-howe made the apology to the family of dorothy groce , known as cherry , who was shot by police during a bungled raid at her home .
mrs groce was paralysed from the chest down following the shooting by armed police , who were searching for her son .
the commissioner also described the operation which saw mrs groce shot as ` inadequate in both its planning and delivery ' she died 26 years later in 2011 from kidney failure , which a pathologist directly linked to the gunshot wound .
