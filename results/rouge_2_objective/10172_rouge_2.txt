the 11ft x 21ft parking space in london 's exclusive hyde park gardens measures just 11ft x 12ft , but its price tag is almost double the # 162,000 paid for the average house sold in england and wales last month .
estate agents kay & co , who last year sold two nearby parking spaces for # 250,000 each , said several people had already expressed an interest in snapping up the six-figure spot .
its buyer will be paying # 1,299 per square foot for the privilege of owning a central space in westminster .
