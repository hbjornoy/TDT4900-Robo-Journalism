michael carrick says he still hopes to be involved in manchester united 's clash with chelsea on sunday after playing just over an hour for the red devils ' under 21s against west ham .
he returned to the bench for united 's 2-2 draw at west brom on monday but manager louis van gaal seemed to have ruled him out of sunday 's game , claiming the midfielder needs more minutes under his belt as he returns from an ankle injury .
carrick was joined by fellow senior star anders lindegaard in united 's starting line-up to play west brom .
