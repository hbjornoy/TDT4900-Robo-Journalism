northampton boss jim mallinder believes the tigers will be ` hurting ' ahead of saturday 's showdown at franklin 's gardens .
the dramatic 21-20 victory for northampton , which was secured by a late tom wood try , ended leicester 's run of appearing in every premiership final since 2004 .
northampton marched on to twickenham , where they beat saracens in similarly dramatic circumstances to be crowned english champions for the first time , and victory this weekend would guarantee they lead the premiership heading into christmas .
