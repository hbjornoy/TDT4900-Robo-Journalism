milagros martinez , whose son javier acosta , 11 , is suffering from cystic fibrosis and is in dire need of a lung transplant .
the organ transplant and procurement network 's policy currently states that sick children under the age of 12 are automatically placed at the bottom of the transplant list and are eligible to receive children 's organs , but those are rare to come by the severity of their disease .
martinez is asking the policy be changed so that children under 12 are placed on the list according to martinez 's suit .
