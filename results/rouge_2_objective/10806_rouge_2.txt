the mars500 crew , however , is so far from the red planet that it is still in a car park in moscow .
the cosmonauts still have 82 days left of their 520-day mission when they will enter the record books again ... for the shortest distance travelled .
the crew was seen ` landing on mars ' after 257 days in the capsule before their return journey to earth .
the experiment is taking place outside the institute of biomedical problems in a 550 cubic metre windowless space .
