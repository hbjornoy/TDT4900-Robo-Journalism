islington council is converting the four-storey grade ii-listed property into one house after it had been split into two flats .
if rented privately the council-owned property could earn around # 2,000 a week but when the family move in after the renovation - which will cost thousands - they will be paying less than # 1,000 a month .
the indian couple , believed to be in their 30s , with four children and another on the way , are said to be amazed by their luck .
