manchester dogs ' home was set on fire on september 11 , killing 60 dogs in the adoption unit , my feeling was that there is no roof , and the floor is covered with blackened material .
among the rubble are dog collars , a tennis ball and several chew toys .
she has already had several litters , perhaps bred for dog-fighting .
