all butch the boston terrier knew was a life of roaming the streets , rifling through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal .
he got to experience unwavering love thanks to alicia buzbee and her daughter kansas , who found him in pinson , alabama and threw him a party before he was put to sleep .
the owner cast the dog out and he was left to live in the streets .
