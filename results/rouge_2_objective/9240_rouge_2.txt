national security agency director keith alexander jousted with a few hecklers as he defended the u.s. spy agency 's surveillance programs at the black hat security conference on wednesday , but largely kept the crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers on his side .
the four-star general , who wore uniform shirt sleeves , was the opening keynote speaker at the annual convention in las vegas .
alexander has been under fire from many civil liberties advocates and lawmakers since former nsa contractor edward snowden leaked documents revealing previously secret telephone and internet surveillance programs run by the u.s. government .
