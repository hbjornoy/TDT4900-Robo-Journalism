australian airline qantas has removed pork from its in-flight menu on routes to and from europe after going into partnership with middle eastern airline emirates .
no food containing pork products will be served on the european flights - which now have a stopover in dubai - because pork is considered ` unholy ' and therefore strictly forbidden by islam .
pork sausages are now banned from qantas flights through europe after a merger with emirates .
