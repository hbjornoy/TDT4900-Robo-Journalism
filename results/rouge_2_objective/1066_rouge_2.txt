manchester city have tabled an opening bid of around # 17million for roma 's unsettled centre-back mehdi benatia , according to reports in italy .
the 27-year-old morocco international is one of two alternatives city have lined up if they decide against pursuing first-choice target eliaquim mangala from fc porto .
benatia has accused the italians of reneging on an agreement made when he signed from udinese for # 10.5 m last summer that guaranteed him a significant pay rise if roma qualified for the champions league .
the player hit out at roma 's pay increase offer of # 2.5m-a-year , with sources claiming that it is # 1m-a-year less than he has been promised at city .
