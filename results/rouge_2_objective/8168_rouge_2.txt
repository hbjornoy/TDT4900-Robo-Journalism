dr jiping liu and colleagues studied the extensive retreat of the ice in the summer and its slow recovery focusing on weather in the northern hemisphere .
global warming means autumn levels of sea ice have dropped by almost 30 per cent since 1979 - but this is likely to trigger more frequent cold snaps such as those that brought blizzards to the uk earlier this month .
the researchers say dramatic loss of ice may alter atmospheric circulation patterns and weaken the westerly winds that blow across the north atlantic ocean from canada to europe .
