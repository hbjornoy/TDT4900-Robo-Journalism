crini will finish his closing statements tomorrow and is expected to request a life in prison sentence for knox and her italian ex-boyfriend raffaele sollecito .
the high court ordered a fresh appeals trial , this time in florence , saying the earlier appeals decision was full of contradictions .
amanda knox and raffaelo sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing meredith kercher , knox 's 21-year-old british roommate , who was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in 2007 .
