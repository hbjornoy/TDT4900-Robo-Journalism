ex-marine eric calley , from williamston , michigan , suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- after serving two tours of duty .
his constant companion nowadays is a doberman pinscher called sun , who is specially trained to help him with his ptsd.she goes everywhere with him including on the december 7 flight .
calley was sitting in coach when a flight attendant from first class walked over and repeatedly yelled at him because sun had put her front paws on an empty seat next to him during some turbulence .
calley has said the apology is n't good enough and that the attendant 's bad behavior was just one of example of how the airline mistreated him
