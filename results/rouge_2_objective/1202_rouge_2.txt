boris johnson was confronted with the exotic meal , piled high on a large salver , yesterday when he met with the uae 's minister of culture and youth sheikh nahyan mubarak al nahyan in abu dhabi .
boris johnson is seldom stuck for a colourful turn of phrase on a trade mission to the gulf , however , he showed that being mayor of london does not mean he ca n't act like every other tourist too - by reaching for his smartphone to take a photo of the local delicacy .
he is said to taste like ` coarse beef ' and can be tough and chewy .
