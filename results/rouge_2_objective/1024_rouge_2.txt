mistle thrushes are being seen in fewer than half the number of gardens they were spotted in 10 years ago .
sightings of the mistle thrush are down 28 per cent between 1995 and 2010 and wildlife experts are asking the public to look out for them and other birds in the annual big garden birdwatch survey .
