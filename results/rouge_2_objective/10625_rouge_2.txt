ryan smith , 17 , was left in a coma after he decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his hair .
he remained in hospital for almost a year following the accident on july 22 , 2013 , near the seaside village of chapel saint leonards , lincolnshire .
ryan 's father , mark , released a heart-breaking image of him cradling his son as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets .
the family were told by doctors that ryan would probably not survive and even if he did , he would be severely disabled .
