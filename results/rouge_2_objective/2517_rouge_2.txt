coachella valley high school has agreed to redesign its arab mascot and his genie sidekick after complaints by anti-discrimination campaigners .
the arab mascot has existed since the 1920s and is a nod to the desert region 's reliance on date farming , a traditionally middle eastern crop .
it came under fire last november when the american-arab anti-discrimination committee sent a letter to the school district complaining that the mascot was stereotypical .
the district refused to change the school 's ` arabs ' nickname for sports teams .
