french prime minister manuel valls said france was overly reliant on the fuel and pledged to wean the country off it .
france 's favoring of the diesel engine was ' a mistake ' more than 30 million cars currently run on diesel in france today , according to the latest figures from the world bank - approximately 80 percent of the total on the road .
most european countries have similar policies because diesel cars are typically more efficient than their petrol counterparts .
