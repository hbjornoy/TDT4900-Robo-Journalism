president barack obama is challenging major cable and telephone companies to expand broadband access by encouraging the federal communications commission to pre-empt state laws that stifle competition for high-speed internet service .
obama wants to expand access to broadband communications services , siding with local communities that want either to expand competition or provide municipal services themselves .
the proposals do not require congressional approval and are part of a series of new measures obama is rolling out before his state of the union address next week .
