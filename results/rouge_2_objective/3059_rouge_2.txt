the centuries-old vase was made for the chinese emperor qianlong , but its hugely important seal of authentication was destroyed when a two centimetre hole was drilled in its bottom to feed an electrical cable through .
the former owner of the antique even customised it with fittings and a garish lampshade , giving it pride of place in his hallway .
experts believe that if he had n't have drilled the hole , then the 15 inch tall vase may have sold for up to # 500,000 .
the vase sold instead for # 47,800 when it was sold at duke 's auctioneers of dorchester , dorset .
