lukas james kamay , 26 , of clifton hill in melbourne 's north east , pleaded guilty to six insider trading charges , but not guilty to the more serious charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime when he appeared in the victorian supreme court on wednesday .
defence lawyer tony isaacs told the court that kamay would apply to have a permanent stay on the charge if it was not withdrawn .
kamay and a friend christopher russell hill , who worked for the australian bureau of statistics , allegedly worked together to trade confidential market-sensitive information that netted about $ 7 million in profits .
he has admitted to stealing money in an alaborate insider trading scam
