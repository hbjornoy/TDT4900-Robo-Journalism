tim sherwood said his aston villa team ` bamboozled ' liverpool and paid particular tribute to christian benteke , fabian delph and jack grealish , the teenager who shone on his wembley debut .
villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the fa cup final against arsenal and end steven gerrard 's dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club .
sherwood was dealt a blow by gabby agbonlahor 's failure to overcome a hamstring injury , but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as liverpool struggled to cope with villa 's fluid attack .
christian benteke is congratulated by aston villa team-mate fabian delph after scoring at wembley
