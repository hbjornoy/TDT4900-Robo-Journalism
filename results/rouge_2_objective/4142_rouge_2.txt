the countess of prince edward looked in good spirits as she arrived at westminster abbey for the queen 's coronation celebrations .
the countess joined the duchess of cambridge and the queen and plumped for a pale frock .
the royal couple were accompanied by favourite designer , bruce oldfield , and their nieces , who looked elegant in navy blue and teal dresses .
their five-year-old son , viscount severn , was not at the abbey but the rest of the senior royals and crowned heads from all over europe did make an appearance .
the queen , too , wore a suit made from ivory jacquard - the same colour in which she was crowned 53 years ago
