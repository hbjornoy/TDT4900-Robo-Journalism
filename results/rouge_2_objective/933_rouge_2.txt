haris vuckic has denied a report on tyneside stating he had already declared his intention to quit st james park , where he has one year left on his contract .
vuckic has scored six times since signing for rangers , including three in his last two appearances as the other members of the newcastle five have managed a paltry 44 minutes of football between them , the slovenian has positively thrived at rangers .
the 22-year-old is clearly relishing the exposure he has been granted .
