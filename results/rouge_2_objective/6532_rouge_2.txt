monty emu , emmanuel oko , chukwuka ugwu and adewunmi nusi were sentenced at winchester crown court today after using fake profiles to con women out of their life savings .
they posed as middle-aged men under the names james richards and melvyn binion to develop a relationship and then start asking for cash .
the bachelor said he would need # 700 to go to india to access the money , funded by the victims , and then would say he had hit problems on the trip and beg for more money to release inheritance .
the cash was paid into bank accounts and transferred to others before it was withdrawn around portsmouth , hampshire .
