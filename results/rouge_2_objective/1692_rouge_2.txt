despite tens of thousands of officers being found breaking the rules of the road , only 753 were punished in the last two years .
figures released under the freedom of information act showed that 75,434 were caught speeding , meaning that less than one per cent were punished .
it has led to accusations that police are routinely let off without proper checks while ordinary drivers automatically face three penalty points and a # 60 fine .
