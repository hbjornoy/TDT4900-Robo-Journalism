the landmark ruling over sandra , who was born in germany and has lived in buenos aires zoo for 20 years , could open the floodgates to thousands of similar cases across argentina .
animal rights campaigners won sandra 's freedom by filing a habeas corpus petition - a document more often used to challenge the legality of holding prisoners - in the capital 's courts last year .
they argued sandra should not be treated as an ` object ' under the law but instead as a ` non-human person ' because of her intelligence and complex way of thinking .
