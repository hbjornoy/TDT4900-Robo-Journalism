kofi mason-sesay , nine , was due to spend several days at st simon 's catholic primary school in stockport , greater manchester , as part of an annual visit .
but despite being tested for ebola and given the all-clear on his arrival in britain last week , parents mounted a campaign to have kofi 's trip cancelled , saying they feared he could pass on the deadly virus to their children .
public health england have confirmed there is no risk in kofi -lrb- right -rrb- or mrs mason-sesay -lrb- left -rrb- attending the 168 pupil school , but parent power led to the initiative being cancelled by governors .
