the cardboard carton containing 80 embossed brass tins in packs of eight was never sent to the western front and they remained unopened -- until now .
the honour of snipping the string tied round the carton and opening the tins for the first time in a century fell to lady emma kitchener , great-great-niece of lord kitchener of khartoum , the then secretary of state for war whose mustachioed face and pointing hand were made famous on britain 's best known first world war recruitment poster .
the carton was found in ireland where it was part of a private collection of great war memorabilia .
