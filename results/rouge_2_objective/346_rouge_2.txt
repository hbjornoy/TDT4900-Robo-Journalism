juliette d'souza , 59 , was jailed for 10 years at london 's blackfriars crown court last friday after she persuaded vulnerable ` patients ' to hand over their life savings - insisting the money would be hung from a sacred tree in the amazon as a sacrifice .
she was believed to have made around # 1million from the con , which she used to pay for first class flights , antique furniture and a # 3,000 hermes handbag .
the victims involved in the court case were ` just a fraction ' of the elaborate scheme .
juliette , of hampstead , charged just # 35 for 23 counts of fraud and deception spanning from 1998 to 2010
