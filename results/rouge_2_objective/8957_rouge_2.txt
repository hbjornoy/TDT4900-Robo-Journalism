tories and lib dems seemed to be suffering from political hangovers as they squeezed elbow-to-elbow around the table at number 10 .
there were glum faces all round as they gathered for the cabinet meeting , with lib dem nick clegg - who yesterday rejected a suggestion to join the tories - surrounded by some of his biggest critics including george osborne and theresa may .
there are glum faces at the far end of the table too , where tory northern ireland secretary theresa villers was surrounded by lib dems .
