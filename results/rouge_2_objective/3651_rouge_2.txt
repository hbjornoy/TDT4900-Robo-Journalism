climbers wanting to scale mount everest will be forced to bring back eight kilograms of rubbish in a bid to clean-up the world 's highest peak .
the rule , one of several new measures covering mountaineering in the himalayan nation , will apply to climbers ascending beyond everest 's base camp from april onwards .
mr burlakoti , who is joint secretary at the ministry , said authorities would take legal action against climbers who failed to comply with the new rule , although it was unclear whether this would involve a fine or the confiscation of their mandatory deposit .
