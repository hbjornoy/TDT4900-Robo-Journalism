qpr midfielder joey barton has revealed a death threat sent to him by a french fan during his time at marseille .
the outspoken englishman spent a season on loan at the ligue 1 outfit in 2012/13 , but according to a letter posted on twitter , was not adored by the entirety of marseille fans .
it appears the author of the ` fan-mail ' does n't count english as his first language , as the abusive piece is littered with grammatical inconsistencies , at one stage telling barton he would ` die a knife ' the man ordered the one-time england midfielder to leave marseille before june 1 2013 .
