daley blind will return to anfield for the first time with manchester united on sunday afternoon .
daley blind is enjoying his time in manchester but admits he had to adapt to the pace of the premier league .
blind is a wide-eyed 10-year-old when his father danny secured tickets for a game against arsenal from jari litmanen , a former team-mate who had signed for liverpool .
the 25-year-old has been an eventful debut in premier league for united to salvage a 2-2 draw against west brom in october last year .
