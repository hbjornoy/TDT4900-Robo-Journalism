charles severance , 54 , who has been charged with the murders of nancy dunning , ron kirby and ruthanne lodato , in alexandria , virginia , was in court for a hearing on thursday .
all three victims were gunned down at their homes in daylight attacks : dunning in 2003 , kirby in 2013 and lodato last year .
severance 's writing appeared to echo a biblical passage and also included the words : ` the last scream of a victim echoes to eternity ... murder on my mind , and my mind on murder .
the prosecution alleged that severance 's plan to kill was outlined in a bizarre piece called ` parable of the knocker '
