wearing a navy blue suit and dark sunglasses , he was accompanied by his girlfriend , brier neil , who did not leave her grief-stricken partner 's side throughout the heart-wrenching service .
abbott has received overhwelming love and support during the past eight days since the tragedy .
abbott was the unfortunate player who delivered the bouncer that struck hughes in the neck during the sheffield shield clash at the sydney cricket ground last tuesday .
