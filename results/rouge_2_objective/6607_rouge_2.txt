sally jones , 45 , who once played in a female punk band , ran away from her home in chatham , kent , to wage jihad with her toyboy husband in raqqa , syria .
the mother-of-two , who slipped into syria at the end of 2013 with her 10-year-old son , is seen punching her hand in the air and shouting arabic chants , which are then echoed by her fellow militants .
experts say the slicky-edited video is the first ` real evidence ' which shows jones is believed to have been filmed leading women fighters in a hate-filled chanting session in syria .
