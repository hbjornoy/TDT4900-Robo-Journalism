sandra fosbrooke was at the nearby stag pub in five roads , which she jointly runs , while her daughter ffion were running riot at her six-bedroom home .
ffion 's mother , sandra fosbrooke , was perhaps entitled to hope for a pretty special 17th birthday party .
mrs fosbrooke , who won # 12.8 million on the lottery in 2005 with her then partner ken henry , would not comment on the chaotic event .
the police had to be called after the party descended into violence , and six arrests were made amid reports of fights and windows being smashed .
