david cameron is warning nick clegg he will get the blame if he blocks a temporary withdrawal from the european convention of human rights to enable the deportation of abu qatada .
sources close to the prime minister made clear he would expect the liberal democrat leader who has insisted he will not countenance any suspension of the echr -- to explain to voters why the hate preacher remained in britain in such circumstances .
mr clegg was kept in the dark about a ` council of war ' ordered by mr cameron on wednesday , as the court of appeal refused the home office permission to take qatada 's case to the supreme court .
