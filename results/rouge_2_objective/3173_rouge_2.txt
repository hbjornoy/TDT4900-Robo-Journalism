the bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the ice at canalside the day the new rink opened on the city 's waterfront .
lisa florczak came up with her version of the ice bike after seeing on the internet that the contraptions were used in beijing .
the bicycles give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice , along with the warm nuts , hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks .
florczak 's family business , water bikes of buffalo , rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the buffalo river in warmer months .
