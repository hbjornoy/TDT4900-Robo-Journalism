government soldiers battled against insurgents from the nusra front group near the disputed golan heights territory after militants took control of the un-operated quneitra border crossing last week .
several shells struck close to the ceasefire line as rocket , mortar and tank fire was exchanged - with israeli public radio reporting that one stray round hit occupied territory but caused no casualties .
golan heights is a 460 square mile region largely seized from syria by israel during the 1967 six-day war of 1967 , then annexed in 1981 in a move never recognised by the international community .
