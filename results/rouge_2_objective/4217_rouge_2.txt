leslie van houten was denied parole for the 20th time 44 years after she participated in a notorious set of murders .
the denial came at the 63-year-old 's 20th parole hearing on wednesday , where the panel heard from relatives of the victims who were opposed to her release .
she wo n't be eligible to ask for parole again for five years , but ferguson said she had failed to explain how someone as intelligent and well-bred as she was could have committed the ` cruel and atrocious ' murders of leno and rosemary la bianca were stabbed to death in august 1969 , one night after manson 's followers killed actress sharon tate and four others .
