andy murray comfortably won his first round match on day one of the australian open tennis tournament .
the sixth seed stayed well on top of his opponent - india 's yuki bhambri - will now play australian marinko matosevic in the second round .
murray 's fiancee kim sears was seen smiling court-side as she watched her husband-to-be put the pressure on the 22-year-old .
this comes as local favourite ana ivanovic , who once dated australian golfer adam scott , was knocked out of the open by czech player lucie hradecka .
