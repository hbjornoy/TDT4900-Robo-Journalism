england captain alastair cook took his first ever test match wicket on the final evening of the first test against india on sunday .
alastair cook comes in to bowl himself from one end to a test that rarely looked like producing a result , the england skipper produced an over of questionable offspin , before steaming in with some slow medium pace and having ishant sharma caught behind in his second over in a test match since 2008 on day five of the test .
cook 's first over was slow off-spin which caused few problems before he switched to medium pace .
