jill stolworthy , from norwich in norfolk , has been a huge fan of the star - who sang double chart-topper living doll - after first seeing him perform 55 years ago when she was just 13 .
the couple snapped up the pop star 's head at a car boot sale in 2012 before giving him a body made from mdf with a cushion ` to give him a bit of chest ' they then used one of mr stolworthy 's old navy blue blazers , which was destined for the charity shop , and a norwich city football scarf to dress the doll .
