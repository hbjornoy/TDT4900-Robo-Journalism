melanie and joseph cassar , from st clair , sydney , feared their dream of becoming parents was over after the last ivf cycle failed .
ms cassar says she knew at age 18 that the road to fertility would be tough after learning that she had polycystic ovarian syndrome -lrb- pcos -rrb- .
doctors explained her ovaries were irregular and covered in cysts , making it difficult to produce eggs capable of fertilisation .
ms cassa has undergone three full ivf treatments and said it costs around $ 8,500 each time , with new changes meaning couples must spend at least $ 2,000 to qualify for the medicare safety net .
