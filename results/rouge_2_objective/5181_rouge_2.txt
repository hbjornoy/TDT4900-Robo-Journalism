women who face the daily embarrassment of not quite reaching the ladies in time could find relief ... with botox .
on average , the number of times they felt an urgent need to go to the toilet also fell , from around eight times a day to under once a day .
about four out of 10 women treated with the powerful neurotoxin became continent again after six weeks and a third were still continent six months after treatment .
the study , published in the journal european urology , was carried out at eight urogynaecology centres in the uk from 2006 to 2009 .
