labour strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the iraq war in the months before the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the liberal democrats in 2005 and 2010 .
lord morris , a former labour attorney general , called for ` clarification ' on whether tony blair , gordon brown or the cabinet office were involved in the delay .
he insisted mr blair must not be allowed to stymie the release of the report into the 2003 conflict , it is now not expected to be ready until early next year .
