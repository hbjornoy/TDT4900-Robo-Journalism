alaska state troopers say the gun went off as james doppler was handling it last weekend .
the 43-year-old anchor point man is expected to make a full recovery after initially treating a gunshot wound to the head for five days with an antibiotic ointment .
troopers say his girlfriend urged him to go the hospital but he refused , believing at the time he did n't need outside help to tend the wound .
the symptoms prompted him to seek treatment thursday at the homer hospital .
