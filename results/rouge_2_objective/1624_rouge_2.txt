diocesan authorities are threatening to remove the vice girls who use the alcoves and churchyard of the anglican cathedral to ply their seedy trade , as well as drunks and drug addicts who desecrate the grounds .
they have spent # 1,000 on more than a dozen signs erected on lampposts around the churchyard warning potential wrong-doers that the site is a ` sacred ancient burial ground ' they fear the ` disgraceful behaviour ' will deter people from enjoying the calm and tranquility of the surroundings .
