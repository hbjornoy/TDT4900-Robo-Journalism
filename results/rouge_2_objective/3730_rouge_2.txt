backpackers katherine ostojic , 21 , and her 19-year-old sister alice , managed to sit on the overturned semi-submerged hull of the stricken vessel for ten hours after it got into difficulty off the island of lombok .
two british sisters who survived 18 hours in the indian ocean after the tour boat they were travelling on sank in rough seas have told how they chose not to join their fellow survivors in drinking urine and eating leaves to an island on the horizon -- a journey which took them eight hours to shore .
the group were rescued by fishermen and all were given food and water before being flown to bali .
