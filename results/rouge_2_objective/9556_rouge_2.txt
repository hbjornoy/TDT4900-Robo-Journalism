high-profile sydney barrister alexander ` sandy ' street is currently embroiled in an expensive dispute with his ex-wife sally street 's mother , helen jenifer mcdonald , over money she lent her daughter 's estranged husband when they were married .
mr street was told in court despite having his payments to ms mcdonald reduced he must pay part of the rent on his ex-wife 's rent and car repayments .
the nsw supreme court heard mr street could n't afford to pay his debts if he was to continue paying the same contributions towards ms street 's car loan and was granted permission to keep more of his barrister 's income .
