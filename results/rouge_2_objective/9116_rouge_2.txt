the man , who was found to be drunk and was already disqualified from driving , was spotted driving down the m60 at 4.50 yesterday afternoon .
when officers finally arrested him on the a57 near irlam sniffer dogs found five wraps of heroin stashed inside his white fiat 500 .
pictures taken inside the car after it was stopped show the floor and seats littered with takeaway wrappers and crisp packets and a pouch of rolling tobacco in the cup holder just above the gear stick is a can of nine per cent special brew .
