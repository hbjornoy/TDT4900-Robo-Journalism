the cleveland daily banner reports the mennonite and five of his children were tossed into the frigid canosauga creek around 4pm wednesday , when their canoe capsized amidst the fast-moving waters .
three of the children - and are all under 10 - were reportedly able to swim to the safety of the creek 's banks , while their dad and siblings were swept away in the currents .
the mennonite creek was reportedly flooded by the seven inches of rainfall that had pounded polk county since sunday .
