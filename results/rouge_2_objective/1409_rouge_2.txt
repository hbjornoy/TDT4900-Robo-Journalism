radamel falcao has been reduced to tears by his manchester united nightmare , according to the colombia star 's former agent .
silvano espindola revealed that falcao phoned him from old trafford last week before he was made to play for the under 21s against tottenham and admitted he felt ` weird ' about the situation .
falcao is earning # 280,000-a-week during his loan to united from monaco , but it looks increasingly unlikely that louis van gaal will sanction a # 43million deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season .
