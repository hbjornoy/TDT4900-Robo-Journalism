jennifer ujimori is being sued by dog tranquility in burke , virginia , after she took her puppy to obedience class and then wrote negative reviews about it on yelp and angie 's list .
the business owner , colleen dermott , filed the suit because she claims ujimori 's reviews were false and they did her business harm .
ujimori brought her dog yuki , a bolognese , to classes at dog tranquility because she wanted the then 14-week-old pooch to get more social so it could become a therapy dog , the washington post reported .
ujimori , 31 , has two young children and is married to a solider .
