uefa on serbia for racist abuse and violence towards england under 21 players .
uefa 's independent control and disciplinary panel fined the serbian fa just # 65,000 - a remarkable # 15,000 less than denmark striker nicklas bendtner was forced to pay for showing branded boxers as part of a goal celebration - for their part in the ugly post-match scenes .
the pfa said they were looking to uefa to send a strong message to the football community that racism would not be tolerated in the game , but were left disappointed by the sanctions .
