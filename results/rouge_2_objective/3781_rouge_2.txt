headstones at the benghazi war cemetery have been torn down and crucifixes smashed with hammers by a mob of extremists , some carrying guns and dressed in combat fatigues .
the headstones commemorating the deaths of allied servicemen , who fought in the western desert campaigns between 1942 to 1943 , lay smashed on the ground .
more than 1,000 soldiers and airmen who lost their lives in the desert wars of montgomery and rommel are buried at the site in eastern libya .
many were members of the famed 7th armoured division , known as the desert rats , who played a crucial role in the see-saw battle for control of libya and egypt between 1941 and 1943 .
