nbc sports network has decided to cancel a hunting show after the host , a lobbyist for the national rifle association , likened his critics to adolf hitler .
makris went on an nra-sponsored radio show and accused them of ` animal racism ' for jumping to the defense of elephants as opposed to other animals .
the network sparked outrage after airing an episode of tony makris 's show , ` under wild skies , ' in which makris kills an african elephant by shooting it in the face and then celebrates the hunt by drinking champagne .
