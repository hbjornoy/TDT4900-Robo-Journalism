dereck chisora wants to make amends for his ugly brawl with veteran american heavyweight kevin johnson by fighting alexander povetkin in moscow this april .
london 's del boy has asked promoter frank warren to lure povetkin into the fight by offering the russian home advantage .
povetkin is not the best heavyweight on the planet but he is dangerous enough to place in jeopardy the final eliminator for a challenge to wladimir klitschko 's wbo title .
