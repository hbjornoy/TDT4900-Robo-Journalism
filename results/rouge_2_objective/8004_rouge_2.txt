scientists are currently competing to create the best invisibility cloak , as imagined in films such as harry potter and star trek .
no-one has managed to replicate a flexible cloak as worn by the boy wizard , or the cloaking device used by the kingons to make their ships invisible to another starship 's sensors , but two canadian scientists have created an invisibility cloak that they say is thin and adaptive to different types and sizes of objects .
this is the set up of the lab where professor george eleftheriades and michael selvanayagam have designed and tested a new approach to cloaking - by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field .
