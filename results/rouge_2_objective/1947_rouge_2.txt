radio 4 listeners could be forgiven for thinking they had tuned in to the wrong station this week .
the bbc aired the first instalment of a ten-part series called summer nights , featuring explicit discussions of swinging , orgasms , and sex toys .
the broadcaster caused further outrage with a 15-minute drama , aired at 10.45 am , which focused on a married man who discovers he is gay by using pornographic websites .
