manchester united must get used to their new style of play under louis van gaal , according to gary neville .
the 20-time english champions have struggled for consistency this season after the dutchman replaced david moyes in the summer , but still lie third in the premier league table .
van gaal has been criticised by supporters and pundits for his tactical stubbornness , with many suggesting he should be forgotten if united want to move forward .
