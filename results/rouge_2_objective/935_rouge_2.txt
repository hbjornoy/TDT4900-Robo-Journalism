jon snow , 64 , said he had eaten a ` strawberry flan ' spiked with the hallucinogenic drug at a party in oxford when he was about 22 .
the channel 4 news veteran revealed the incident on his blog , coincidentally only hours ahead of presenting the controversial television show , drugs live , last night .
the drug may also have affected mr snow 's memory , because the m40 opened in 1967 , the london to oxford stretch was not completed until 1974 .
