bill cosby came back to haunt the comedian once again on monday when a supposedly harmless social media stunt blew up in his face .
cosby posted an invitation on twitter on monday afternoon asking fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him .
the comedian 's intention was no doubt for fans to post lightly humorous posts like the ` happy monday !
' example in his original tweet , but instead fans focused on a series of rape allegations that have been levelled at him .
