the move by education secretary nicky morgan is intended to stop islamic extremists from ` brainwashing ' children .
mrs morgan drew up the proposals in the wake of the ` trojan horse ' plot by radical muslims to take over schools in birmingham , which led to the government rushing in new measures to compel schools to teach ` british values ' of tolerance .
the education secretary wants to amend the religious studies gcse course , which stipulates that pupils should study one ` world religion ' -- usually restricted to their school 's faith .
