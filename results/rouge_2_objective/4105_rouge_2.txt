the long range acoustic device , which is made in america , will also be used to control possible riots at the football european championships this summer .
the devices were tested by the mod last week during a major security exercise before the olympics .
they can emit noises of up to 150 decibels and are said to be highly directional , meaning security forces are able to point the devices at clear target groups .
