dvla has been operating a ` money-making scam ' after figures yesterday showed clamping soared after the paperless system was introduced in october last year .
many say the authority was too quick to penalise motorists without first warning that their car was not taxed .
the dvla was accused of ` heavy-handed and draconian ' behaviour yesterday after figures showed its use of clamping rocketed by 60 per cent from about 5,000 vehicles a month before the changes to 8,630 last month .
