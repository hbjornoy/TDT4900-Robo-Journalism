tanya angus , from las vegas , spent the last 12 years trying to find a cure for her acromegaly , which meant she could n't stop growing .
until the age of 21 , tanya was just 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 130lbs .
she was fired from her post when her condition worsened , causing massive amounts of growth hormone to be released into her body .
miss angus has died at the age 34 after her heart failed due to her extreme size .
