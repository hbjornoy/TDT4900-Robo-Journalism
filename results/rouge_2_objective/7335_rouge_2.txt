demonstrators took to the streets of berkeley , california for yet another march monday night to protest the police-related deaths of michael brown and eric garner .
the march brought traffic to a crawl on both directions of interstate 80 just before 9pm local time , as hundreds of protesters walked out onto the freeway .
the downtown berkeley bart station was also shut down , and protesters in nearby emeryville were pictured dramatically laying down on the tracks in front of amtrak trains .
police were eventually able to break up the group , but cops and protesters faced off again on a pedestrian bridge stretching across the major thoroughfare .
