two albuquerque police officers were charged with murder monday in the shooting death of a knife-wielding homeless man that led to sometimes violent protests and a federal investigation into the city 's police force .
the decision to bring murder charges occurred at a time when police tactics are under intense scrutiny nationwide , fueled by the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old in ferguson , missouri , and the chokehold death of another unarmed man in new york city .
