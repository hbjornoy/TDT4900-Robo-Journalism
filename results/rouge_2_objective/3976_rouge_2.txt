five passengers are presumed dead after a small plane crashed tragically into the icy depths of a colorado reservoir saturday afternoon .
it was a recovery mission from the start as crews at the ridgeway reservoir worked to fish out the single-engine socata tbm700 and the bodies of everyone aboard after they fell out of the sky for undetermined reasons around 2pm .
efforts were suspended saturday evening , in part because responders to the rugged rural area lacked equipment necessary to recover the wreckage and victims from 60 to 90 feet of frigid water about 90 feet from shore .
the plane was flying from bartlesville , oklahoma , to montrose , about 180 miles southwest of denver ,
