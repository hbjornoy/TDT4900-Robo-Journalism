traffic had started to build up on the m58 around switch island on merseyside , with one motorist filming the gridlock on a dashcam .
one driver in a silver mercedes obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane , where vehicles were merging .
the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past .
