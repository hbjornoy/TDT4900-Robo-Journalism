honywood community science school dished out ipad2 tablets to its 1,200 pupils a year ago , at vast cost to the taxpayer .
despite warnings that children would not be able to look after the fragile computer tablet , the school in coggeshall , essex , allowed children to take the device outside the classroom , playground and street and home at evenings and weekends .
the ipads would be a useful learning tool , as well as keep the school up to pace with international competitors embracing the technology in the classroom .
