footage shot by drone pilot tom caska captured the moment a huge shark started following a sea of fish 50 metres off the shore at killcare beach on the nsw central coast last friday .
mr caska 's brother andrew was on one of the three-metre long paddle boards when the shark started circling , but was completely unaware of his close call until he saw the footage .
the shark , believed to be a great white , and the school of fish are clearly visibly in the aerial photo just metres from several surfers .
