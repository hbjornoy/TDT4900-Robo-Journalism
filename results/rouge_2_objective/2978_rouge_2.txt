minnesota vikings running back adrian peterson and his legal team are reportedly close to reaching a plea deal in his child abuse case in texas on tuesday .
the disgraced football star , 29 , faces one felony count of reckless injury to a child after he was accused of striking his 4-year-old son with a tree branch or switch at his gated mansion in the woodlands .
the case could be resolved as early as tuesday , when peterson is due back in court for a hearing to revoke his bond after he allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana before his initial hearing in september .
the vikings star has been on paid leave since his arrest .
