social commentator and feminist jane caro insulted generations of women when she compared marriage to prostitution , a women 's advocate says .
caro said her comments on abc tv 's q&a on monday night were not aimed at modern wives , but she was speaking about the institution of marriage in the past .
she has since adamantly stood by her comments while trying to clarify that she was not saying people 's ` grandmothers ' are prostitutes .
