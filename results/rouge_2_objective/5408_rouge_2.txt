heather walker testified through tears on monday that the child 's grandmother does n't deserve to live after being convicted of capital murder in the death of savannah hardin .
heather walker took the stand in support of prosecutors who want the death penalty for her former mother-in-law , joyce hardin garrard .
walker , who is divorced from garrard 's son robert , died in 2012 after her grandmother punished her by making her run around the house for three hours .
