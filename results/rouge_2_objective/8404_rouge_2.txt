manuel bola√±o , born in barcelona but raised in galicia , a sensitive , self-confessed introvert , called his latest offering the boy with sad eyes .
his collection of bug-embossed netting , clashing textures and gothic lace-up boots was shown on the fourth day of the 080 barcelona fashion 2014 yesterday .
influences appeared to be romantic , retro , sports and gothic introvert boots as a quirky outfit of clashing textures is offset by a bashed-up beauty look .
