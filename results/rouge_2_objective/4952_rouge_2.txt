gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said in an interview with abc that aired on this week .
dempsey 's interview aired on the same day defense secretary chuck hagel warned that islamic radicals are perilously close to taking a key city along syria 's border with turkey .
the u.s. has launched more than two dozen airstrikes against isis in the syrian city , even after the u.s. state department dispatched gen. john allen to the country last thursday to plead for their help .
he also urged turkey to open a closed-off corridor to kobane 's remaining residents and to allow arms to flow through the country to kurds fighting against isis
