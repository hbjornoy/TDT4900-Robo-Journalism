lewis hamilton will not jeopardise his chances of winning the spanish grand prix by repeating the erratic driving style he deployed at the last race in china .
hamilton , who will again start on pole position here in barcelona , slowed down and weaved during the parade lap three weeks ago , causing the cars behind him to slam on their brakes and in some cases to stop altogether .
the mail on sunday has learnt that race officials discussed hamilton 's strange behaviour at the time but decided not to penalise him .
