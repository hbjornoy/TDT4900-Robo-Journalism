pj spraggins was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife tracy , who was told her life-long battle with lupus would kill her if she did n't get a transplant .
the couple from birmingham , alabama , were dealt a blow : his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation .
she was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34-year-old sister , who also had lupus , died following complications from a kidney transplant .
