hundreds of meatballs laced with rat poison have been scattered around san francisco in an apparent attempt to sicken or even kill local dogs .
at least two animals have already been struck down after eating the tainted meat , including a seven-year-old dachshund called oskar who remains in critical but stable condition .
police are warning residents about the nasty prank they called a ` truly unusual ' crime after the meatballs were discovered in the twin peaks , diamond heights , lower haight , cole valley , hayes valley and bernal heights neighborhoods .
