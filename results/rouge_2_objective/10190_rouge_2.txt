artist yulia brodskaya 's intricate creations are made using a technique called ` quilling ' , which involves using strips of paper that have been rolled and then twisted into shape .
yulia 's wonderful work looks like the result of careful work with a paintbrush but in origami and a degree in graphic communication , quilling was n't in brodskaya 's early plans but she says it takes a couple of days to make the simple designs and a few weeks for more elaborate and complicated pieces such as the man leading the horse and cart are picked out clearly in this creation .
brodskaya itself dates back to the renaissance when it was used by monks and nuns
