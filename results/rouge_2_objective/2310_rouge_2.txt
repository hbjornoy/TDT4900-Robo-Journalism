sublimotion is part of the brand new hard rock hotel in ibiza , which celebrated its grand opening this weekend with a huge open-air beach concert .
this is the newest restaurant from two-michelin star spanish chef paco roncero - spain 's version of experimental chef heston blumenthal - and i am among the first people in the world invited to sample its unusual concept .
the owners stand by the price , they say the cost of setting up the restaurant , the quality of the food and the 27 staff for a dozen diners explains the price .
