pensions minister steve webb said the elderly were driven ` up the wall ' by politicians lumping the weekly payment with other welfare payments .
the government was going to stop referring to the state pension , worth # 113 a week , as a benefit because of the stigma attached to claiming welfare .
labour has previously suggested that the pension could be included in a future welfare cap after the election .
