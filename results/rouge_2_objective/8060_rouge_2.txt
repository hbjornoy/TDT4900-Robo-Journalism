ales basista , 53 , from stupava in the czech republic , has been keeping lions since 2012 , and has done everything from nursing them back the health to playing with them in the garden .
his neighbours and friends meanwhile have been very critical of decision to keep and raise the lions , and many others around the world have disagreed with keeping lions as private pets .
mr basista rescued his first lion from a circus when it was seven months old at the time .
