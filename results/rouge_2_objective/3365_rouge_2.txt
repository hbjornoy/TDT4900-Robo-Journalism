one member of the hms bounty 's 16-person crew died and walbridge was never found after the sinking off north carolina 's outer banks , an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks .
the newly released ntsb report said captain robin walbridge 's ` reckless decision ' to sail into the storm subjected the aging vessel and its inexperienced crew to conditions they could n't surmount .
