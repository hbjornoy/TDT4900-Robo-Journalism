jermaine kearse would lead the seattle seahawks to a spectacular victory with one of the craziest catches in super bowl history .
the 24-year-old wide receiver used every part of his body to make the unbelievable bobbling catch late in the fourth quarter of the game - it was n't enough to see off the new england patriots .
quarterback russell wilson was moving the seahawks down the field in a bid to erase a four-point deficit .
kearse refused to let the ball touch the ground - and an incredible circus catch saw him juggle the ball four times before bringing it under his control .
