manchester united manager louis van gaal will contest the disrepute charge for criticising referee chris foy after his team 's fa cup draw at cambridge two weeks ago .
van gaal said it was ` always the same ' with referees when bigger teams play against smaller clubs , leading the fa to charge him with implying bias on foy 's part .
united manager will request a personal hearing with the governing body at which he will explain he was just trying to make a general point .
the fa used to pick on the club simply because of its standing in the game .
