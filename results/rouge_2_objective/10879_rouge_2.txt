andrew young , 40 , died after lewis gill smashed him in the face in an unprovoked attack .
the mother of an asperger 's sufferer killed with one punch condemned the ` soft touch ' justice after judges upheld a four-year sentence for lewis gill , 21 , who killed her son with a single punch .
the court of appeal ruled gill 's four-year term was not unduly lenient even though the 21-year-old is likely to serve just half of that .
the decision sparked public anger and mr young 's mother pamela said it showed criminals were not being held to account .
