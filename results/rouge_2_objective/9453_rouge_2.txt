sam miller had been alerted to an age-profession image of paul fronczak , a baby stolen from his mother 's arms a day after his birth in 1964 by a woman disguised as a nurse .
the investigation to find fronczak was re-opened last year after a dna test proved a man long-believed to be the missing child , who was found abandoned in a stroller in new jersey in 1965 and subsequently adopted by the fronczak family , was not actually him .
sam miller , a microsoft executive , grew up in a suburb outside chicago but did not learn he was adopted until earlier this year .
