gay men in relationships could be able to give blood for the first time since the aids epidemic of the eighties under a shake-up of medical laws .
the move to allow homosexual men will mark a significant change to current rules which prevent gay men from giving blood unless they have been celibate for a year .
this rule was put in place because gay men are more statistically likely to have hepatitis b and hiv .
