joe hart has declared that he totally respects the authority of manuel pellegrini , as the manchester city boss comes under increased pressure at the etihad stadium following defeat to barcelona .
the goalkeeper was outstanding as city were beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the champions league , with only his string of saves over the two legs preventing pellegrini 's side from an even more embarrassing result .
hart was dropped by the chilean following a poor run of form last season , but returned soon afterwards as manchester city went on to win the premier league title and the capital one cup .
