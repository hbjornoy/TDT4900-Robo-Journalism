the algarve region in portugal offers the best getaway bargain for the long easter weekend , a study found .
in the algarve , the cost of meals , drinks and ice creams has dropped 20 per cent over the past year following the pound 's rise against the euro .
a meal including drinks will cost a family of four just # 29.87 , which is almost # 7 less than last year .
the story is similar in the other eurozone resorts , with prices in the costas almost as cheap as the algarve following a 15 per cent drop from 2014 .
