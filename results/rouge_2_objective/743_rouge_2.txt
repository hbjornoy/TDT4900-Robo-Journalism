west ham manager sam allardyce has criticised referee mike dean for his handling of saturday 's london derby defeat by crystal palace .
the hammers , currently in ninth place in the premier league , were beaten 3-1 by the eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest .
allardyce felt that palace striker glenn murray , scorer of two goals at upton park , before being sent off in the 69th minute , should have been dismissed by dean in the first half for persistent fouling .
glenn murray was sent off for crystal palace during the 3-1 win against west ham on saturday .
