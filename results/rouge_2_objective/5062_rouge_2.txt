pole princess owner anastacia snellesk says she is almost $ 100,000 out of pocket after the city of boroondara council threw out her application to move the classes from kew to hawthorn east -- but not until after she had signed a new lease , paid the rent and spent thousands of dollars on renovations .
the fiery claims have started a war with outraged clients , who have been branded strippers and ` undesirables ' , insisting they are well-educated professionals who signed up to simply have fun .
the council received eight complaints involving parking , noise and a ` pornographic ' sign - which is a picture of ms snellesk .
