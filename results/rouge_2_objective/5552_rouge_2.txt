sales for danish toymaker lego soared 25 per cent last year , thanks in part to its new series of building blocks designed for girls .
the company , based in western denmark , said the lego star wars and lego ninjago series remained among the more popular , but it was a novel rollout for girls , lego friends , that sold so well production units were unable to keep pace with demand .
