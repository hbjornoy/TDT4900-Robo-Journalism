photographer souvik kundu shows a tiger sparing the deer 's life and , instead of making it an easy snack , deciding to play with it and treat it like one of its own .
the moment occurred at the tadoba andhari tiger reserve in india with the confused tiger snapped jumping next to the tiny deer , nuzzling with it , and even carrying it gently in its mouth like a cub .
the unlikely two appear to become the best of friends , with the gentle tigress tenderly playing with it before leaving the deer unharmed to live another day .
