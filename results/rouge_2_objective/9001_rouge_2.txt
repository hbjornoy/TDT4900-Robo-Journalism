asylum seekers began hunger strikes last week at the australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre , demanding the immigration department halt a scheduled january 22 transfer of 50 male detainees to temporary , insecure housing in lorengau , the manus capital .
two-thirds of asylum seekers at manus island are on hunger strike and up to 14 people have been refusing to eat and in some cases drink in the protests that have been escalating over the past week .
asylum seekers have also written to manus island service providers asking that their organs be donated should they die in detention .
