russia has conducted an exercise designed to test the transport of nuclear weapons near europe , according to us officials .
the drill was the largest of its kind in two decades and was carried out as part of larger military drills last month .
it is said to have sparked concern inside the pentagon and us european command but a defence spokesman played the incident down .
the drills took place between february 17 and 21 and follow an increase in strategic bomber flights by russian forces off the us pacific island of guam and simulated bombing runs against alaska and california last june .
