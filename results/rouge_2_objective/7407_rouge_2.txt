the powerball jackpot jumped to $ 550 million on thursday -- the third largest lottery in history -- as dreamers in all but the seven states where the game is n't played snatched up tickets for the minuscule chance at a life on easy street .
thursday 's announcement by the iowa-based multi-state lottery association means ticket sales have soared since wednesday night 's drawing for an estimated $ 360 million jackpot , in which no one picked all six numbers correctly .
sales jumped by $ 260 million in the days before november 's biggest powerball jackpot win in history .
