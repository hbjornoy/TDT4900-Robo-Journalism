germ-ridden towels could be the worst culprits for spreading bugs around the home , researchers have warned .
the problem is two fold : first , towels retain moisture for long periods of time , allowing the bacteria to survive - and are used in the kitchen and bathroom .
the recent study , from the university of arizona , found coliform bacteria - bacteria present in faeces which can lead to outbreaks of food poisoning and diarrhoea - in 89 per cent of towels .
