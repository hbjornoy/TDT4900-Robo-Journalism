everton defender john stones was the shock name on barcelona 's shopping list of central defenders last summer .
barcelona ended up signing 31-year-old jeremy mathieu from valencia for # 14.5 m and 29-year-old thomas vermaelen from arsenal for # 15m but influential voices at the catalan club urged then sporting director andoni zubizarreta to bid for 20-year-old stones instead .
the former barnsley defender moved himself up the list of possible targets with performances for everton that saw the youngster on the stand-by list for england 's world cup campaign in brazil .
barcelona were desperate for defensive reinforcements at the end of last season .
