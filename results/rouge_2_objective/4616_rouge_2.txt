pensioner gwen trickett has cleaned up with the ancient vacuum cleaner she bought for a few pounds more than half a century ago .
mrs trickett , 77 , bought a new plastic cleaner ten years ago but used it just once and dumped it in a corner before returning to trusty hoover junior .
the hoover junior would have cost mrs trickett # 20 in the mid 1950s which was twice the average weekly wage at the time .
