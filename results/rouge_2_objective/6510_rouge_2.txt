the 62-year-old will be joined at united by former holland striker patrick kluivert , goalkeeping coach frans hoek , fitness coach jos van dijk and paul scholes and phil neville are up in the air , and they may be forced to take on junior roles or - in the worst-case scenario - move on altogether .
