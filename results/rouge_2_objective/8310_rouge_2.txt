ben carson , the african-american former pediatric neurosurgeon whose conservative speeches have rallied the republican party 's right wing , was accused tuesday of plagiarizing portions of a best-selling book he wrote in 2012 .
the revelation will prove embarrassing to the probable 2016 presidential contender : in the same book carson describes being caught plagiarizing part of an assignment during his college years .
carson is being urged to run for the white house by a ` draft ' movement that includes a $ 12 million political action committee .
