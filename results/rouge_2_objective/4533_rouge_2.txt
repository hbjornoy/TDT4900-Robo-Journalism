manchester united 's new assistant coach albert stuivenberg has spoken of the ` unique opportunity ' to work alongside louis van gaal at old trafford .
the former holland under-21 coach has been working with assistant boss ryan giggs at carrington for the past few days while van gaal completes his world cup commitments with the dutch national team in brazil .
united 's players stayed late at training on tuesday as they were put through a double session , having played a small-sided game using half a pitch on monday when pre-season training officially got underway .
stuivenberg previously worked with van gaal as the dutch under-21s manager .
