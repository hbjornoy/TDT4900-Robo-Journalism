atiya 's mother , gemma wilkinson , is said to be ` terrified ' about her former partner razwan anjum , who is now in prison after abducting their daughter atiya and is set to ask appeal judges to release him from jail early .
atiya , now six , was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to reveal where she was set to make a fresh bid for freedom .
