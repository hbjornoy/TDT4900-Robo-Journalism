jenson button can understand the reasoning why fernando alonso will not be making his second debut with mclaren this weekend .
on the advice of doctors , alonso is absent from the season-opening australian grand prix after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month .
fears were expressed to alonso of ` second-impact syndrome ' whereby a serious brain injury , or even death , could occur should the 33-year-old be involved in a second incident so soon after the formula one season gets underway in melbourne on sunday .
