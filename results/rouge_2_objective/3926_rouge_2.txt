teenage heptathlon star morgan lake has pulled out of england 's team for the commonwealth games in glasgow , partly because her father is not allowed to stay in the athletes ' village .
lake 's father , eldon , is also second behind johnson-thompson on the under 20s all-time list after scoring 6,081 points in gotzis , austria last month .
lake cleared a high jump personal best of 1.93 m in loughborough in may , the second highest jump by a british athlete this year .
she will now hope to be selected for great britain 's team at the world juniors from july 22 to 27 , -- a single-sport , much smaller event than the commonwealth
