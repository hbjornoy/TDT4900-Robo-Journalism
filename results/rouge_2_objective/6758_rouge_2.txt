virgin galactic , the space flight company owned by sir richard branson , says the space tourism plane is currently developing could be modified and turned into a super jet .
the concorde-like aircraft would travel outside of the earth 's atmosphere and enter orbit , using gravitational forces to travel at incredibly fast speeds .
the virgin galactic ship ss2 , seen here on a test flight in the mojave desert , might one day be modified to allow high speed orbital travel from country to sydney in two and a half hours .
