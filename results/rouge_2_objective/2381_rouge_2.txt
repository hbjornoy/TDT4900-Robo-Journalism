kieran conry , the roman catholic bishop of arundel and brighton , confessed on saturday to being an ` unfaithful ' priest .
he also stands accused of a second affair with a married parishioner 20 years his junior , who spent at least three nights at his home .
the lawyer is representing the husband of a 43-year-old parishioner to whom the bishop had become close , and claimed he was considering a possible high court action against church chiefs .
bishop conry , 63 , said he felt ` liberated ' knowing he no longer has to bear the burden of his guilt alone .
