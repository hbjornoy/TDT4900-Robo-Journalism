facebook users in the u.s. will soon be able to see which of their friends are nearby using a new feature that the company launched on thursday .
the nearby friends feature must be turned on by the user , so people should n't expect to broadcast their location unknowingly .
it will use your smartphone 's gps system to tell your facebook friends you are nearby - provided they have the feature turned on as well .
facebook , whose motto has long been ` move fast and break things , ' built a lot of precautions in washington .
