tim sherwood and chris ramsey may become a united force again in seasons to come up as rival managers .
they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top-flight football .
there was adrenaline , action , twists and turns as ramsey and sherwood went head to head at villa park .
sherwood was out at pitchside much earlier than his friend and rival , then charlie austin gave qpr a taste of victory before christian benteke wiped it away with his hat-trick goal .
