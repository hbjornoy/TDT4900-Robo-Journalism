each year , the new york police department and the fire department of new york get together for a friendly ice hockey game , all in the name of charity .
the charity match has been held for 41 years , but this year 's match degenerated into an ugly scene in the second period when the teams were matched at three-three .
players from both sides can be seen on youtube videos of the fight clearing the bench to join the brawl , which left the ice littered with hockey sticks and gloves .
