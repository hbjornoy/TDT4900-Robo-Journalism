league tables , 330 schools fell below the government 's ` floor target ' for gcse results in 2014 , up from 154 in 2013 .
in those schools , fewer than 40 per cent of pupils gained at least five c grades at gcse , including english and maths .
the increase is because of new government rules which ban schools from including results from re-sits and poor-quality vocational courses .
