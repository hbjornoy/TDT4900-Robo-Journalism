the european commission has bottled it over plans to ban restaurants from serving olive oil in glass jugs or dipping bowls .

david cameron criticised the ban , saying it was ` exactly the sort of area that the european union needs to get right out of ' other politicians also pressed brussels to drop the dippy rule .
