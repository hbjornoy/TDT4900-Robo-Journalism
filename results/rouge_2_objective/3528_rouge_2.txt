unusual fossils unearthed in coal deposits of the czech republic have been combined to create a map of the first ever reptile skull .
the study was undertaken by experts from comenius university in bratislava alongside a uk team which included the natural history museum in london and the university of lincoln .
the reconstruction pieced together previously unrecognised skeletons from the nýřany basin to create the skull features of the late carboniferous gephyrostegus bohemicus bohemicus .
this was a small animal of generally lizard-like build that lived 308 million years ago .
