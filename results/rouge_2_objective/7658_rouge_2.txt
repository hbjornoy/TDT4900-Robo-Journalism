manchester city are keeping tabs on juventus striker alvaro morata ahead of possible summer bid .
the spain international was a target for arsenal a year ago when he left real madrid but opted for a move to italy instead .
city remain one of the clubs pushing to sign the france international too and juventus have a buy-back option set at around # 15million but are unlikely to take that up .
