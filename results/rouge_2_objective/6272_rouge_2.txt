chief greg suhr announced in a statement friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers .
he called the texts ` despicable ' and says those who sent them ` clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer ' the offensive texts were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant ian furminger , who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison .
suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that do n't have contact with the public .
