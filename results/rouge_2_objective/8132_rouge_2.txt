russian president vladimir putin has fired a top russian olympic official after publicly ridiculing him on a visit to the winter olympics site .
the current price tag for the sochi games is 1.5 trillion rubles -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- , which would make them the most expensive games in the history of the olympics - more costly even than the much-larger summer olympics held in london and beijing .
