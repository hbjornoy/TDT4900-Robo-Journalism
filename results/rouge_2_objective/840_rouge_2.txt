gareth southgate has urged his players not to make the same mistake as ben flower and let indiscipline ruin their chances of reaching euro 2015 .
southgate has made a point of telling his young squad since they arrived in vinkovci about the perils of losing their cool in what will be an intense atmosphere and he has used the example of the wigan prop flower , who was sent off for punching st helens ' lance hohaia in the grand final at old trafford on saturday night .
england are braced for croatia using intimidatory tactics in the second leg , which they trail 2-1 , and southgate does not want to see indiscipline ruin all the good work
