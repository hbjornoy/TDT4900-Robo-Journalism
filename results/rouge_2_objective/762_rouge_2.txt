neighbors say the home is a ` maternity mansion , ' a hotel where chinese women stay for the last few months of their pregnancy so their children are born on american soil - and are therefore american citizens .
the 14th amendment guarantees that any person born in the united states is an american citizen and is afforded all the rights granted by the constitution .
the house is owned by a man who runs asiamchild.com , a site that sells space for chinese mothers who want to give birth to babies in america .
