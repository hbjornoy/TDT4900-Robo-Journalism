chichester college , in west sussex , has been dishing up halal chicken and lamb to unsuspecting diners at their main refectory .
the move came after a sudden rise in the number of middle eastern students at the college , which has been rated ` outstanding ' by ofsted and takes pupils aged between 16 and 19 .
one outraged diner , who did n't want to be named , said : ' i feel very strongly about food labelling and the consumer should know what they are eating ' halal meat comes from the traditional muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut then having their blood drained .
