andy cannon , 23 , was sexually abused by his adoptive gay parents but his complaints to social workers were ignored .
the report accuses wakefield social services , in yorkshire , of ` folly and gross misjudgment ' mr cannon , who was wrongly diagnosed with mental disorders and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs , believes he would have been listened to sooner if his adoptive father was n't gay .
the case ended last year , after half a decade of legal wrangling , when a court ordered a # 25,000 compensation payment to mr cannon .
