serial pest gordon clarke was found guilty of harassment without violence earlier this month after he repeatedly lit bonfires in his back garden in crawley , west sussex , to deliberately send smelly smoke all over the neighbourhood magistrates court heard .
the 52-year-old - who was jailed for 70 days in 1998 for breaking a restraining order and for nine months in 2008 for breaching his asbo - has caused misery to his neighbours john ferraira , lara sanger and graham sanger for the last 25 years .
