sex offender jang-li delgado galban , 25 , has been linked to two civilian jail services workers at the hillsboro jail identified as brett robinson , 32 , and 38-year-old jill curry .
the inmate 's name was first made public thursday by the station kptv .
robinson was arrested earlier this week on multiple counts of custodial sexual misconduct after officials learned of her alleged affair with the inmate while investigating jill delgado-galban .
the 38-year-old veteran jail worker , who is married to a sheriff 's deputy , was arrested last month on similar charges stemming from her alleged tryst with mr delgado-galban .
