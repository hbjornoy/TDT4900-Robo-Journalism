the woman , known by the pseudonym rehana , was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the besieged syrian border city after an image of her making a peace sign was retweeted over 5,000 times .
friends of rehana have told mailonline that the dead woman in the photograph is in fact a different kurdish resistance fighter , adding that rehana managed to escape kobane during intense fighting there last week and is now believed to be living in southern turkey .
the kurdish fighter rehana - who became a poster girl for the kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by islamic state militants - is actually alive and well , her friends claimed today .
