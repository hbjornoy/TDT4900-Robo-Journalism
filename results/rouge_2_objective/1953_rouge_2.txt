brendan rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities , insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage liverpool under the fenway sports group model .
it has been a difficult week for rodgers , with the meek manner of last sunday 's 2-1 defeat by aston villa in the fa cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three-year reign at the club .
brendan rodgers insists he is the man to guide liverpool to success despite a disappointing season .
rodgers has been boosted by the news that jordan henderson has not stopped jurgen klopp -- who will leave borussia dortmund at the end of the campaign .
