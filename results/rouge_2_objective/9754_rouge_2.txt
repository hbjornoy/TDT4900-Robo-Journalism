doctors at peking university hospital in beijing first removed a tumour located in the second vertebra of the boy 's neck before replacing it with the 3d-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae to allow him to lift his head .
the five-hour surgery was a world first and will enable the boy named minghao to walk again after spending two months confined to a hospital bed .
minghao had been lying flat in the orthopedics ward - he could only occasionally stand up but just for a few minutes at a time .
