sergio aguero has been turning up the heat off the pitch ahead of the new season as his manchester city side look to retain the premier league title .
the 26-year-old was pictured with the club 's chef on thursday with the food on display looking as good as the argentine 's goal record since joining the club three years ago .
aguero has proved to be a huge asset to city in that time scoring a number of crucial goals , none more so than the one against queens park rangers which secured them their first title in 44 years .
city are hopeful of tying up aguero to a long-term contract at the club sooner rather than later
