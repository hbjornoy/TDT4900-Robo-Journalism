cathy lisa and kay mellor 's 90s tv hit band of gold - cathy tyson had a reputation for being a bit chippy .
she 'd arrive late for interviews , answer questions dismissively and even turned hollywood down after being told to lose weight .
she has the perfectly sculpted cheekbones and feline eyes that made her one of britain 's most recognisable stars .
