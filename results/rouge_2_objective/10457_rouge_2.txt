liverpool legend jamie carragher has launched a scathing attack on arsenal defender and world cup-winner per mertesacker .
the german centre half looked short on form and confidence as the gunners lost 3-2 to stoke at the britannia stadium , and carragher believes mertesacker let his team-mates .
arsenal struggled to deal with bojan -lrb- right -rrb- for large periods - calum chambers was sent off for this challenge .
jamie carragher described per mertesacker 's performance against stoke city as ` unacceptable ' peter crouch scored the first 25 seconds against arsenal and mertesacker was partly at fault .
