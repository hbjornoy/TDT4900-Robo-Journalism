princess charlene was making the most of a rare night away from her two-month-old twins , jacques and gabriella .
the event , which was held at the monte-carlo casino , was the work of the princess charlene of monaco foundation and was intended to raise funds for its learn to swim programme .
charlene , a former olympic swimmer , is passionate about water safety and , in 2014 alone , her foundation taught 40,000 children how to take to the sea in safety .
the group , who will arrive next month , will take part in the saint devote rugby tournament next month .
