the rc sugoi mop works like a regular mop but is operated by remote control , which means you can clean the floor from the comfort of your sofa .
amazingly , the robo-mob , which comes in colourful canary yellow plastic , costs just # 19 - similar to traditional mops and far less than high-tech steam versions .
the invention is arguably more useful than other gadgets that have come from japan in recent years .
