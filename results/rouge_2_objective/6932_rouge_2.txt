italian prosecutors named the world cup-winning midfielder as part of a wide-ranging investigation on tuesday , providing evidence that the ex-ac milan star had been contacted by a go-between working on behalf of a match-rigging gang .
former rangers star rino gattuso put his life on the line against accusations of match fixing by declaring that he would kill himself in the street if found guilty of such a crime .
gattuso made 73 appearances for italy and won the german world cup in 2006 .
