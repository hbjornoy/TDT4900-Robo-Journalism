raymond verheijen believes louis van gaal is to blame for luke shaw 's injury .
england left back shaw , signed from southampton in the summer for # 27million , may be out for a month with a hamstring problem and will definitely miss the start of the premier league campaign at home to swansea city on saturday .
verheijen called fellow dutchman van gaal a ` great appointment ' by united but at the same time accused the former netherlands manager of incompetence and of working his players too hard .
verheijen believes united 's extra training sessions were the cause of shaw 's pre-season injury crisis due to `` too much training too soon ''
