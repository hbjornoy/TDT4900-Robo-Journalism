barcelona defender gerard pique has agreed a three-year contract extension that ties him to the club until 2019 .
the spain international has been an integral part of barcelona 's success , helping the club win two champions leagues titles and five of the past six league trophies since his arrival in 2008 .
pique has made 266 appearances for barcelona , scoring 20 goals , and will most likely partner sergio ramos in the centre of defence for spain in brazil this year .
