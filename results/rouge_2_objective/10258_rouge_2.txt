tragically murphy was so frightened of the paparazzi outside her home she had turned into a social recluse and was reluctant to receive medical help when she first started having trouble breathing .
miss murphy 's mother sharon only called 911 after her daughter sank into her arms , lifeless , on the morning of december 20 , 2009 .
the coroner attributed her death to pneumonia and anaemia - the same ailments that would kill her husband , british filmmaker simon monjack , 40 , five months later .
she was also very sedated due to the drugs she was taking and so may not have appeared as ill as she was seen by doctors 24 hours earlier .
