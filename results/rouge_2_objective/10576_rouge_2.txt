kevin de bruyne is linked with bayern munich as a potential replacement for the former france international or his team-mate arjen robben .
de bruyne , who spent his two years at chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed bundesliga club , has scored nine goals this season .
bayern 's franck ribery says he is the wrong style of player to come in under pep guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the holland winger .
ribery says de bruyne 's counter-attacking skills do n't mesh with the style of pep guardiola .
