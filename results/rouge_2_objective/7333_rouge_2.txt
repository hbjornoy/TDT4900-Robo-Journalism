leeds united owner massimo cellino could soon face an unprecedented charge of misconduct from the football league that may end his troubled stay at elland road .
the league 's board , who met this week , have lost patience with the cellino camp over the long delay in receiving the written reasons why cellino was found guilty by a sardinian court of evading import tax duty on his yacht .
the next step will be a danger of leeds going out of business if the italian is forced out .
cellino 's italian legal representative prof giovanni cocco has reportedly been available for over two months .
