roxanna hoffman gave birth to four girls and one boy on friday the 13th as her husband , michael hoffman , stood by her side at banner good samaritan medical center in phoenix , arizona .
the couple , who were living at luke air force base , new jersey where michael was a staff sergeant , until they relocated to be close to the phoenix hospital , let their son conner name his new siblings .
the six-year-old chose aurora , brielle , delilah , elias and felicity - so the children 's names , including conner 's , now match up with the first six letters of the alphabet .
