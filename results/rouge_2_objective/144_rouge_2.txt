marcel kittel , 26 , claimed the winding streets , enclosed by dry stone walls , were ` risky ' for riders taking part in the 118-mile first stage of the event .
the german cyclist has warned yorkshire 's roads could be too narrow as more than four million spectators line the walls , narrowing the path and potentially leading to accidents .
kittel , who made his tour de france debut in 2012 , is one of british cyclist mark cavendish 's main rivals in the opening stage , with both of them vying to win the green jersey .
