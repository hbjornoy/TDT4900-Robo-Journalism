rodney sinclair , professor of dermatology at the epworth hospital and university of melbourne , explains the science of hair colour - and why some of us are cursed with more greys than others ... what determines the colour of hair ?
hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes , which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero .
the melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades .
