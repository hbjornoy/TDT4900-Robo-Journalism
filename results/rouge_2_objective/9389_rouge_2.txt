nine year-old danny purdy saved up # 7 of his own pocket money to get a style like that of his favourite gunner .
his mum sarah said he came back from school in tears after a telling off from his teachers at brooklands middle school in leighton buzzard , bedfordshire .
she says she was told danny would have to stay in isolation until his hair is ` rectified ' she has now asked the school for materials so she can tutor danny from home until the row is resolved .
