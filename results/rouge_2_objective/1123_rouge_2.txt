pedro hernandez was just a name in a file for decades , one of many people police encountered while searching for a 6-year-old boy named etan patz .
opening statements are set for friday in hernandez 's murder and kidnapping trial .
he emerged as a suspect in 2012 , based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s .
his defense will hinge on convincing jurors that the confession is false , along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years .
