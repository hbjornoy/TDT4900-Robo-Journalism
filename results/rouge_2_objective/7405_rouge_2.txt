the queen 's rowbarge gloriana has been damaged after it crashed into a bridge when its engines failed .
the # 1million royal barge gloriana had a rather more undignified outing on the river .
she was gliding majestically down the thames at the head of the diamond jubilee flotilla .
the winds then blew her back against the bridge , scraping her side and knocking the crown into the water .
