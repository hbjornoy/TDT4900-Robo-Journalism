dave heeley , 57 , from west bromwich , ran the gruelling challenge over six days as he battled through sand dunes , dried river beds and rocks .
the super-fit father-of-three , known affectionately by his friends as ` blind dave ' , took part in the marathon des sables where competitors carry provisions on their backs and temperatures can rise to 50 degrees .
mr heeley has raised funds for the albion foundation , a charity that works in partnership with his beloved west brom to use sport as a way to help the local community .
