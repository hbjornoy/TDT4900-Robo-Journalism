the 6ft long ichthyosaur was discovered by a fossil hunter at low tide after rough seas tore away a section of cliff .
the unnamed fossil enthusiast worked tirelessly for three days to collect the 200 million-year-old remains before expected storms would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian .
he removed sections of rock from the cliffs known as black ven , near lyme regis , dorset , and took them to local preparator chris moore .
