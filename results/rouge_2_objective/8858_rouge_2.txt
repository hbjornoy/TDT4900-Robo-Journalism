benjamin medrano has been hailed as a significant victory for gay rights in mexico , where homosexuals often feel oppressed due to the conservative catholic culture .
his victory in the city of fresnillo came despite a smear campaign against him in which his political rivals criticised him to voters ` as if gay were a crime ' the city is located in zacatecas state in central mexico , a largely rural region famous for a macho culture where men wear cowboy hats and boots , and a state plagued by shootouts between drug gangs .
