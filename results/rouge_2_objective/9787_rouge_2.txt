juan mata and juan mata have all been enjoying manchester united 's new signing ander herrera 's birthday .
the spaniard turned 25 on wednesday and team-mate javier hernandez posted a snap on instagram of the foursome with a message in spanish wishing the midfielder a happy birthday .
hernandez could be moving to juventus as part of the deal for chilean midfielder arturo vidal , but he looked happy as larry as he smiled with his fellow red devils .
the spanish central midfielder is expected to pull the strings in midfield in united 's premier league opener against swansea on saturday .
