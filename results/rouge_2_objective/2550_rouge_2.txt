20 passengers , some of them screaming and trampling others , fled through emergency doors and onto the tarmac at a los angeles international airport terminal monday morning .
the ` misinformed announcement ' near a boarding area apparently stemmed from a police pursuit of an unarmed driver that ended outside terminal 2 .
police responded to an emergency call around 9am reporting that a man may be trying to commit suicide .
they apprehended the man , and the fire department took him to a hospital for treatment of an unspecified condition .
the arrest led someone inside the terminal to incorrectly state that there was a ` man with a gun , which was not true , '
