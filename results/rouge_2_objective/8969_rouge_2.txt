the london fire brigade -lrb- lfb -rrb- has said that it will explore the idea of setting up the world 's first 999 emergency feed to ease pressure on the telephone service which takes more than 30million calls a year .
twitter users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters and bypass 999 calls under proposals aimed at making communication with the uk 's biggest fire service easier .
the plans , which are part of the brigade 's draft london safety plan , will not replace the 999 system .
