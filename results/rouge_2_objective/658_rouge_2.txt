marcos rojo will travel to lisbon on friday to finally collect his work visa .
the # 16million manchester united signing from sporting lisbon has been unable to collect his visa owing to his alleged involvement in a criminal investigation dating back to 2010 for which he has not been charged .
he initially travelled to england on a tourist visa last month but already qualified for his work permit automatically having played 75 per cent of argentina 's internationals over the past two years .
