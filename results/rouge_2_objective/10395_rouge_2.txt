the collective ceremony , which was billed the first of its kind to be held in china , was organised by a new social media app designed for pets .
a traditional wedding march played as the love-struck pooches were led down the aisle by their owners to ` exchange vows ' and receive marriage certificates .
forty-two dogs tied the knot at the wedding , which is complete with tulle wedding dresses and celebrity owners .
no expense was spared for the special occasion , as the 21 canine couples arrived in bmw convertibles and a stretch hummer limousine .
