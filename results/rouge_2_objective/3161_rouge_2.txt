ronnie biggs made his last escape yesterday afternoon -- to the hereafter .
his wicker coffin draped in the flags of britain and his adopted brazil , the best-known -- if least important -- of the great train robbers was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same north london crematorium as sigmund freud , george bernard shaw and the maharaja of cooch-behar .
