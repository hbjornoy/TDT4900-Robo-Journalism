roberto martinez has not ruled out the prospect of antolin alcaraz or sylvain distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club 's future .
both centre-backs ' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely distin , who is 38 in december and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team , will be retained .
alcaraz , 33 in july , has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer .
roberto martinez insists his club 's recruitment team have been searching for six months
