arsenal forward yaya sanogo has asked to join the french club on loan .
the 21-year old is behind a plethora of attacking options in the pecking order at arsenal with alexis sanchez , olivier giroud , danny welbeck and theo walcott all vying for a starting spot .
arsene wenger is happy for the former auxerre striker to head out on loan but would much prefer sanogo , who has only featured six times for the gunners this season .
