online booking agent wotif confirmed they are dumping their $ 5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $ 20 million dollars back into the pockets of australian consumers .
they are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $ 16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $ 9.95 per person .
wotif has been praised for the move , consumers who expected to see a drop in prices may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent .
