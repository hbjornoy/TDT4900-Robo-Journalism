george osborne is facing calls to reject any demand for rbs to increase its payouts to senior staff in the city .
david cameron announced cash payouts would be capped at # 2,000 but rbs is expected to invoke an eu rule that allows it to pay bonuses in shares up to double an employee 's salary - twice the normal rate - provided they are approved by the shareholders .
labour 's call for a cap on bonuses was dismissed as unworkable by bank of england governor mark carney .
