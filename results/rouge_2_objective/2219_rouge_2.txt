toyota 's i-road personal mobility vehicle is designed for negotiating busy city streets and is no wider than a standard motorbike , but can be driven like a car thanks to intelligent front wheels that automatically adjust to suit the driver 's actions .
the trike uses ` active lean ' technology that allows its wheels to move up and down to calculate the best position for going round tight corners , or weaving in and out of traffic .
the i-road could be the answer for people who like the idea of cutting through traffic on a motorbike .
