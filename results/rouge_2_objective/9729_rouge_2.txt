charity shops have been accused of abandoning their traditional clientele by selling used items for hundreds of pounds .
many have effectively become mini-boutiques offering cast-off designer clothes and accessories , as well as high-end art and books , at prices beyond the means of most hard-pressed consumers .
the country now has 10,000 charity shops , which enjoy generous tax breaks not available to other shopkeepers .
