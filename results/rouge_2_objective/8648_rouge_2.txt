scientists admitted to being surprised by the discovery , which indicates that even insects show signs of intelligence .
the research was carried out by tasking flies with picking between two similar odours , and it was found they thought longer when the decision was harder .
scientists asked fruit flies to distinguish between ever closer concentrations of an odour they were trained to avoid .
the flies acted quickly to move to the end of a chamber furthest away from the strongest smell .
