the two day event took place at bicentennial park on glebe foreshore , in the inner west sydney , new south wales , where dogs from rspca and 12 other animal shelters were matched with their perfect owner on saturday and rulers of the cat world strutted their stuff on sunday .
the reign of cats and dogs has arrived , as both saturday and sunday saw a huge success for our four-legged friends at an event that aimed to adopt out dogs and parade famous cats .
