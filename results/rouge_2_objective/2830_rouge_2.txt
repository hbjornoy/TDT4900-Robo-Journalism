many of the images have been lit in such a way they resemble mind tricks , optical illusions and even ink blots .
the images were shot by 33-year-old yudy sauw at his home studio in tangerang , indonesia .
he has captured extreme close-ups of creepy crawlies - revealing the complex compound eyes of flies , the triangular profile of a praying mantis and a moth during metamorphosis among others .
he used a photography technique known as focus stacking , which combines multiple shots of the same subject , taken at different focal distances .
