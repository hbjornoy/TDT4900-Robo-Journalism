the sierra leone-flagged , 240ft livestock carrier was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern italian coast .
it had been put on a collision course for the italian coast but ran out of fuel , officials said .
earlier , rescuers boarded the ezadeen - a 50 year old ship designed to transport cattle - after a passenger raised the alarm as it drifted in the mediterranean .
it is believed the migrants were victims of smugglers using an alternative route to the usual one from libya .
italy 's coastguard tweeted to say the ship had arrived in to port shortly before 10pm gmt .
