melony gallagher , a cat owner from plymouth , slept soundly in bed on christmas eve , her beloved pet suki was left with only one conclusion to draw - that suki had hitched a ride on his sleigh .
she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of plymouth in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph .
she was found on christmas day with her g-paws tracker hinting at a magical ride .
the readings from the g-paws device show the route suki is supposed to have taken - in a straight line over the rooftops .
