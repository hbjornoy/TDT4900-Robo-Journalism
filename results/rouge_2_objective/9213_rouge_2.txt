long-jumper chris tomlinson tore his hamstring as great britain and northern ireland lost out to germany in the sainsbury 's glasgow international match .
the 33-year-old suffered a huge blow in his first jump of the season and there was more disappointment to follow for britain as tomlinson 's fellow teessider , world indoor champion richard kilty , was disqualified from the 60 metres for a false start .
britain trailed in third place going into the final four events of 16 at the emirates arena and a double relay win and jessica judd 's comfortable 1500m triumph proved insufficient to claim the prize .
