lazio players from albania and serbia have come together to set an example of how football can transcend the world of politics .
political tension between the two nations spilled over during a euro 2016 qualifier when a drone carrying an albanian flag provoked a mass brawl that eventually saw the match in belgrade abandoned .
albanian internationals lorik cana , etrit berisha and thomas strakosha share the same lazio dressing room with serbia 's filip djordevic and the group have joined hands in a picture posted on twitter to promote a positive message .
