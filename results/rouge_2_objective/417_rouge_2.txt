visitors who turned up to a d-day commemoration wearing nazi uniform were banned from shops and accused of being insensitive and offensive .
visitors in nazi uniforms tried to hijack the two-day event , upsetting a number of people including a group of german visitors to the town which is a tourist hotspot because of its links with the bronte family .
organisers decided to take action but were powerless to ban offensive clothing , so teashops , pubs and stores put up no nazi notices and refused to serve anyone in ss uniform .
