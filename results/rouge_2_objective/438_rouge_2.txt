bradley manning , the american soldier accused of leaking us military secrets to wikileaks , made his first public appearance on tuesday in over two years as he appeared at a maryland courthouse .
the informant is expected to testify at some point during the week-long pre-trial hearing where he was tortured during his nine months in custody at quantico naval base in virginia .
he was locked up alone in a small cell during this time and had to sleep naked for several nights .
manning was kept tightly confined partly because another prisoner had recently committed suicide .
