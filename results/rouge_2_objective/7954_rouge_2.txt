new hampshire sen. jeanne shaheen on tuesday became the latest democrat to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from president barack obama in order to pacify her electorate .
at a debate last night against her republican opponent , former massachusetts sen. scott brown , shaheen was asked a ` yes or no ' question about whether she is doing .
brown has made shaheen 's history of supporting the president 's agenda a key part of his offensive in the new hampshire senate race .
