flea collars for pets are being withdrawn from sale after the mail on sunday revealed fears that they could poison children .
leading manufacturer bob martin is taking the action voluntarily after dog and cat owners began calling the company demanding to know the risks .
it follows our report last week about a french decision to ban pet collars containing diazinon , which was originally developed as a second world war nerve gas .
french scientists are studying three cases in which children may have absorbed diazinon , also known as dimpylate , through their skin after repeatedly cuddling or sleeping with pets .
