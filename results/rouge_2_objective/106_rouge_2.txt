james wignall , 16 , was left ` staggered ' after officers accused him of frightening his neighbour 's horses as he trained in the country lane outside his home in croston , near chorley , lancashire .
the 16-year-old , who has won 14 of his 17 fights so far including a north west title , said : ' i thought it was a joke at first .
it is not as if he is breaking the law .
two officers came out - the visit came just months after the constabulary confessed they were no longer attending certain categories of crime including ` routine ' burglaries .
