nasa has provided funding to the university of southern california to develop a specific 3d printing technique known as contour crafting .
the most promising of these is 3d printing , which could make building a lunar home in space a matter of pressing a button and letting a robot do the work .
the layered fabrication technology sees concrete , or other material such as lunar soil , applied in a pre-determined design by a nozzle on a moveable gantry .
