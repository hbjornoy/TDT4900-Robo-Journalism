the office of naval research is researching uniforms which can detect where soldiers have been shot - and also detect whether they have been exposed to nuclear or biological agents .
sensors for blood , radiation and chemical poisons would be woven into the uniforms themselves - dubbed ` intelligent uniforms ' the uniforms - in a proposal submitted by the onr this week - would also carry gps units and radios , so their assessment of a soldier 's health can be radioed back to base .
