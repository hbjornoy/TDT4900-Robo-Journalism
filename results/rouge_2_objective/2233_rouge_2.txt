expensively dressed and clutching his briefcase dr fawas akhras is no usual pedestrian , he is the father-in-law of hated tyrant bashar al-assad and apologist for his brutal regime and its atrocities .
akhras , whose daughter asma is married to the syrian president , was probably on his way to work as a cardiologist on london 's exclusive harley street .
he has not been seen in the area since may but he reappeared this week .
