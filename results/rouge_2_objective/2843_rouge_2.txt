austrian designers , maya pindeus , 24 , and johanna pichlbauer , 25 , have created a robot that takes the effort out of applying make-up - by doing it for you .
the device applies eyeliner with a long black brush , while an attachment smears lipstick on lips , before lighting up when the process is complete .
the robot made its debut at the exhibition , biennale internationale design saint-etienne 2015 , in france , and gallery visitors were in for a treat .
