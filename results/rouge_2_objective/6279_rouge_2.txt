u.s. district court judge richard leon announced on monday that the extensive spying program likely breaks the fourth amendment , which is the right that protects americans against unlawful searches and seizures .
the ruling is a boost for exiled edward snowden who exposed details of the nsa 's huge data collection program to the public earlier this year , and is now exiled in russia .
the nsa was revealed to be keeping track of phone calls made by americans both abroad and overseas .
