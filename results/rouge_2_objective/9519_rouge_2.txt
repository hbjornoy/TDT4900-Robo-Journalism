each winter since 2009 the city has come alight with mind-bending light shows projected onto iconic buildings such as the sydney harbour bridge , customs house and the museum of contemporary art .
in 2015 the festival , which also includes a plethora of art , has expanded its installations outside the cbd and includes the newly erected central park in chippendale and the north shore suburb of chatswood .
exhibits will still be found at circular quay , the rocks , darling harbour , pyrmont and martin place .
this year will feature the city 's first ever interactive skyscraper illumination that can be controlled by visitors .
