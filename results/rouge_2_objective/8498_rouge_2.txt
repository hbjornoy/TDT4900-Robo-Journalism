danny stewart was returning home to his partner peter mercurio in august 2000 when he saw what he thought was a doll lying in the corner of the 14th street a/c/e subway station in manhattan .
he saw the little legs wriggling and realized it was a baby boy wrapped in a sweatshirt .
the fathers say their son , who is now a teenager , is a ` gift ' who was brought into their life by chance .
