over the past seven days the assembled media have abided by the fbi 's requests to maintain that jimmy lee dykes , who had access to tv and internet in his underground bunker , did not learn of their plans or get spooked by the growing force around him .
fbi agents built a mock bunker nearby the scene to work out how best to conduct the raid .
