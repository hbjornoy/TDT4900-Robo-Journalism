syrian fighter jet streaks across the sky in eastern al-ghouta , near damascus and drops two unguided bombs into a heavily populated civilian area .
the jet , which appears to be an su-24 , flew low over the al-gouta area during its bombing run before leaving the scene at high speed .
the mission is believed to be in response to an earlier attack islamist fighters struck the syrian capital with at least 38 rockets on sunday .
