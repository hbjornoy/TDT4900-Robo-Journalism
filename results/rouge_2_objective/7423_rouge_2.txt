andy murray practised under the scorching melbourne sun on saturday - but the british no 1 will be playing under the lights on sunday .
murray 's last-16 clash against wimbledon conqueror grigor dimitrov has been scheduled as the second match on rod laver arena on sunday night at around 8:30 pm -lrb- 9:30 am uk time -rrb- .
murray has been in fine form so far down , winning nine of nine sets played so far , and has also received a boost with 17-time grand slam champion roger federer being removed from his quarter of the draw on friday .
