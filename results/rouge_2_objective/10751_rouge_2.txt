the british fashion designer john galliano has been stripped of france 's highest civilian award -- because of his conviction for racism .
the 51-year-old was made a legion d'honneur three years ago by the then conservative president nicolas sarkozy .
the conviction resulted in a fine equivalent to just under # 50,00 and related to a series of anti-semitic rants in his local paris bar .
galliano was found guilty of making ` public insults based on origin , religious affiliation , race or ethnicity '
