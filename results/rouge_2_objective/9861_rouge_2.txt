andy kovac spotted a buck wandering around his backyard in pittsburgh , pa. on wednesday sporting a very interesting hat .
kovac was able to snap some photos and send them to kdka .
the deer had a basketball stuck between its antlers but did n't contact the gaming commission because the ball does n't impair the deer 's ability to eat food .
