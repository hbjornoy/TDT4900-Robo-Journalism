nissan is ready to replace the mirror with a screen showing footage from a camera mounted on the back of the car .
the carmaker claims that its redesigned rear view mirror will boost safety because the image seen by the driver will not be obscured by back-seat passengers , headrests luggage or dirty rear windscreens .
it will also allow rear windows to be made smaller -- allowing cars to be more streamlined and aerodynamic -- which in turn will help cut fuel consumption .
