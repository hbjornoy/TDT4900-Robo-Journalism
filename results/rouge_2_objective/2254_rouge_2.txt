tony hogg , the # 85,000-a-year tory police and crime commissioner for devon and cornwall , is receiving # 650 a month in public funds for accommodation to make his drive to work shorter .
the allowance has outraged rank-and-file police , who say he could stay free in an en suite room at a navy camp where staying monday to friday would cost only # 340 a month -- but his office insists he is not profiting from the arrangement .
he has chosen to save # 40 million over the past two years .
