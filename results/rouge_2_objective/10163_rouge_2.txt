officers in south manchester have started dishing out the tickets to children and teenagers they see behaving well on the neighbourhood 's streets .
the scheme is currently being trialled around didsbury and chorlton - with the aim of encouraging good behaviour among youngsters .
the ` positive tickets ' have so far been given out when officers see youths using pedestrian crossings , putting their litter in the bin , riding their bike on the road instead of the pavement or using bike lights at night .
mario culpeper , 21 , served a year in a young offenders ' institute for a violent street robbery and was well-known to police growing up in chorlton .
