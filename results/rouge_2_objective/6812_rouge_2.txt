diego costa will not be risked if they have any doubts about the chelsea striker 's fitness after calling him up for next week 's european championship qualifiers .
chelsea boss jose mourinho would have preferred to see costa rested for the matches against slovakia and luxembourg so the in-form forward could receive treatment on his hamstring .
costa has been in prolific goalscoring form since his # 32million summer move to stamford bridge but mourinho revealed last week that the former atletico madrid man was barely training for fear of exacerbating his hamstring problems .
