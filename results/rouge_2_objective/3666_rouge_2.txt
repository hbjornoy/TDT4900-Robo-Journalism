loic remy showed his delight at chelsea 's win against aston villa by performing a bizarre dance in his hotel room after the match .
paul lambert 's villa side scored for the first time 11 hours through jores okore but still lost 2-1 after goals from blues duo eden hazard and branislav ivanovic .
remy celebrated the win by dancing on camera , filmed by team-mate kurt zouma - who evidently found the performance hysterical .
