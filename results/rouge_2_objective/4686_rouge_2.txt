brooklyn 's district attorney has been accused of using locked hotel rooms as ` private jails ' to interrogate witnesses and pressure them into giving false testimony in court .
the office of charles hynes is said to have routinely held trial witnesses against their will , according to new court papers filed by a lawyer representing a man suing for $ 150million for a wrongful murder conviction .
the papers were filed in connection with a lawsuit by rudin 's client jabbar collins , who spent 15 years in jail for the murder of a brooklyn rabbi .
