woolworths have launched a new campaign to sell misshapen produce as a means of offering better deals .
the supermarket chain has kicked off the odd bunch initiative nationally this week , offering seasonal savings on the lumpy and misshapen counterparts of your favourite fresh foods .
it comes three months after harris farm launched a comparable operation , the imperfect picks range , which offered up to 50 per cent off produce with minor visual imperfections .
it is believed about 25 per cent of fresh produce is discarded due to imperfections or cosmetic damage .
