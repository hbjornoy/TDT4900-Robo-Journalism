cristiano ronaldo may have been voted the world 's best player on monday night - his second consecutive win and third overall - and gushed about lionel messi , hailing his great rival for helping him become a better player .
ronaldo beat messi to the award as he was crowned the 2014 ballon d'or winner after a stellar 12 months .
the real madrid superstar could not bring himself to include messi in his top three players in the world , instead choosing to opt for team-mates sergio ramos , gareth bale and karim benzema .
