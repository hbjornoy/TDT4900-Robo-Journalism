rear-admiral sir horatio nelson is undoubtedly a national hero .
nelson wrote the letter to the 2nd earl of camden in october 1804 to explain why his nephew had left the hms victory just a few months after joining the navy .
the letter was sent to lord camden 's home at bayham abbey estate , near frant , east sussex , and nelson tells lord camden that 16-year-old francis james left hms victory because he was not suited to naval life and suffered from seasickness - a condition he could sympathise with life at sea .
