bill de blasio , the first democrat elected mayor of new york city in a generation , is a massachusetts-raised former supporter of the communist sandinistas who married a lesbian poet .
he worked as a junior aide to the last democratic mayor , david dinkins .
he served in the clinton administration and ran hillary clinton 's 2000 bid for the u.s. senate .
he is not necessarily a product of the party political machine like previous democratic mayors - in part because that machinery no longer exists in the way it once did .
