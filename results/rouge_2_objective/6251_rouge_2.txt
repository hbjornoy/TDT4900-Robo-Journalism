labour mps are hatching secret plans to wreck any deal with the scottish nationalists by holding an emergency summit after the election .
a meeting of the entire parliamentary labour party -lrb- plp -rrb- would be convened in order to veto any attempt by mr miliband to win downing street by brokering a deal with nicola sturgeon 's snp .
