henri lansbury will not sign a new contract at nottingham forest and is set to join burnley in a deal worth around # 3.5 million as he looks to fulfil his ambition for premier league football .
forest owner fawaz al-hasawi has challenged lansbury , 23 , to put pen to paper on a deal first offered in february but it is understood that the terms are significantly less than other team-mates and he has informed manager stuart pearce of his intention to leave .
burnley boss sean dyche is keen on the midfielder , who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the city ground from arsenal for # 1m in 2012 .
