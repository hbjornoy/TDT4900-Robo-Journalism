liverpool have been in the spotlight recently after media reports suggested brendan rodgers asked roy hodgson to rest raheem sterling for england 's euro 2016 qualifying fixture against estonia last week .
rodgers denied those claims and played down any club-versus-country row , but writing in the independent on sunday , venables said hodgson should not have to consult premier league managers when selecting players .
venables was in charge of the england national senior team between 1994 and 1996 .
brendan rodgers and roy hodgson have clashed over the handling of liverpool starlet raheem sterling .
