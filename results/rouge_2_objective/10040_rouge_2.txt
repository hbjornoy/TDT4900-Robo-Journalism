the probe , named hayabusa-2 , is expected to be flung into space in december on a four year voyage to the asteroid 1999ju3 .
it will release a powerful cannon which will fire a metal bullet at the asteroid 's barren crust , once the probe itself has scuttled to safety on the far side of the rock .
the probe is the successor to jaxa 's first asteroid explorer , hayabusa - the japanese term for falcon - which returned to earth in 2010 with dust samples after a trouble-plagued seven-year mission .
