facebook has refused to remove a video of a kitten being doused in petrol and set on fire because the footage does not breach any of the social network 's rules .
in the shocking clip , two unidentified men can be seen apparently torturing a young kitten by stuffing it into a bucket , pouring flammable liquid over the animal and setting it on fire .
more than 14,000 users have commented on the clip - many expressing their disgust - but despite complaints , facebook has not removed the two minute film .
