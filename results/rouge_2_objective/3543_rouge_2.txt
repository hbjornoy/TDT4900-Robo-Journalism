bronies dressed in colourful equine-inspired outfits outside the buck brony convention .
the bronies , most of whom are aged between 18 and 35 , also express their love for my little pony by writing poetry and fan fiction , creating pony-themed avatars and by attending conventions , one of the largest of which is held in manchester .
