study by media regulator ofcom found that last year britons listened to an average 22.5 hours of radio each week -- an increase of 24 minutes on 2010 .
the medium was less popular with younger people , with those aged 15 to 24 listening to only 17 hours a week -- a fall of 22 per cent in ten years .
ofcom said the reason was down to young people using music sharing websites such as spotify and soundcloud , and the increase in mp3 music players , such as ipods , which can hold thousands of songs on one device .
