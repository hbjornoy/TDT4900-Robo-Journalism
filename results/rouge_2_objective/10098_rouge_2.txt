michael faux , 28 , lee sowe , 30 , and jamie upton , 31 , used a land rover to ram the back wall of a jewellery store in ashton-under-lyne , greater manchester , so it collapsed .
the gang stole vehicles fitted them with false number plates to use in the robbery a few days before the incident on october 4 last year .
the land rover was then used to repeatedly ram into the back of rekha jewellers on penny meadow in ashton town centre as the family who run it were closing up , causing the ram-raiding gang who have been jailed for 30 years .
