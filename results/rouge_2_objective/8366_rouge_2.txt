the grand gesture was secretly organised by marc fury , 34 , from cardiff , who popped the question to long-term girlfriend naomi coleman , 36 , over dinner .
marc arranged for choir group sing & inspire to turn up for the ultimate proposal , and after being serenaded by a mash-up of bruno mars ' ` just the way you are ' and whitney houston 's ` i wan na dance with somebody ' he plucked up his courage and got down on one knee .
marc organised whole event in just three weeks , having seen a flashmob and deciding it would be the perfect way for him to pop the question .
