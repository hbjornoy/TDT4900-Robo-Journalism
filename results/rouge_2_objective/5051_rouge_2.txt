the moon comes from detailed gravity mapping by twin nasa spacecraft , which slipped into orbit around the celestial body earlier this year to peer into the interior .
researchers have long known that the moon and rocky planets - including the earth - suffered heavy bombardment from asteroids and comets during their formative years billions of years ago .
the moon is ` far more broken up and shattered than we 've seen before , ' said mission chief scientist maria zuber of the massachusetts institute of technology .
