five-month-old habul khatoon was one of 430,000 babies chosen by doctors at sheffield children 's hospital to be screened for five serious conditions .
the test showed that habul has the rare metabolic condition , maple syrup urine disease -lrb- msud -rrb- , which causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood .
five-month-old habul was diagnosed because she took part in the newborn screening just six days after she was just hours from death .
