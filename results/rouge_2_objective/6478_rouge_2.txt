former labour health secretary patricia hewitt said there was a growing number of areas , including a range of cardiac procedures , where indian doctors could deliver similar or better clinical outcomes at substantially lower costs than the nhs .
the scheme could also see nhs doctors being flown to india to make huge savings for cash-strapped uk hospitals -- while cheaper indian doctors come to the uk to perform operations .
mrs hewitt said she expected ` a half dozen to a dozen ' trusts of uk companies to have entered agreements with indian healthcare firms by 2015 .
