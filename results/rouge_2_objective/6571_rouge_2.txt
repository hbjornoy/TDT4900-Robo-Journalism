everton team-mate ross barkley will have to wait patiently for a place in england 's midfield .
barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his england debut in september 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for everton last season which earned him a place at last summer 's world cup in brazil .
barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and everton manager roberto martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing , as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle .
