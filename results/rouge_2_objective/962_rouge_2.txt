new parody video takes aim at the wage inequality between genders by introducing a fictional amazon prime service that caters to the average woman , who earns just 78 cents for every dollar a man in the same job makes .
comedian paul gale created the satirical ad for ` amazon prime women ' , which is marketed as the online retailer 's attempt to make itself more appealing to its female members , who make less money than their male counterparts .
the video shows that women can buy more than three quarters of a box of cereal , books , umbrellas and sweaters -- all at a special female rate .
