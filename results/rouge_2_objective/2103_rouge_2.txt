an fbi mole who met with osama bin laden was later killed by al qaeda operatives who suspected he was a u.s. informant .
the fbi recruited the mole in 1993 when he was the driver and close confidant of the ` blind sheik ' omar abdel-rahman - the mastermind behind the 1993 world trade center attack .
intel from the meeting between the informant and bin laden led to the fbi thwarting a terrorist attack .
