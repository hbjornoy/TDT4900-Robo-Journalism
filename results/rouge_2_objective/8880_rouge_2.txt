former home secretary david blunkett has admitted he would find it tough if roma gipsies moved into his own street .
the labour politician allowed migrants from poland , slovakia and hungary to work in britain from 2004 , resulting in one of the biggest waves of immigration ever seen in the uk .
he warned that the influx of roma migrants would result in riots in british cities last year and suggested they should ` change their culture ' as it was more than one million workers from eastern europe arrived between 2004 and the end of 2009 .
