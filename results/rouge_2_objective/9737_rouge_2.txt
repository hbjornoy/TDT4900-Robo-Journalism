enveloping blackpool is continuing apace as a feud between karl oyston and former assistant manager bart de roover was reignited on tuesday .
de roover left his post last week after refusing to sign a contract at bloomfield road - outspoken in slamming the way in which the underfire chairman runs the club .
oyston opted to bite back a weekly column for the town 's newspaper , poking fun at the ex-coach despite the seasiders becoming embroiled in a farcical situation whereby manager jose riga does n't know whether he is to be sacked or not .
