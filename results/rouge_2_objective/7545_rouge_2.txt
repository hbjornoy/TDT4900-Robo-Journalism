the disabled cat , called freeman , was sitting in its front garden when the two dogs pounced , dragging the terrified cat on to its neighbour 's lawn before tearing into the family pet .
police are now investigating after a person , who appears to be a woman , pulls up in a blue car and collects the hounds - leaving the cat to die in agony .
the 90-second attack was captured on cctv by a neighbour who passed the footage on to the cat 's owner tracy lynch , from tarring , west sussex .
