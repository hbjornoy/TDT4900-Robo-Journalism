former maths teacher tony hawken , 57 , is splitting from xiu li , 51 , because he is fed up with being wealthy .
the couple were catapulted into the world of the super-rich after li 's idea of building shopping centres in disused chinese air-raid shelters earned her an estimated # 1.1 billion by 2011 and placed her on the sunday times rich list .
li , who is now worth $ 1.2 billion -lrb- # 700million -rrb- according to forbes , quickly settled into a life which included sipping a # 900 bottle of wine on a luxurious yacht .
