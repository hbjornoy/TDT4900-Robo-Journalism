researchers from lancaster university found that as more people wear hoodies , jeans and warmer clothes , offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels they used to maintain this temperature .
office temperatures are designed for people wearing suits but as fewer people wear suits , and dress more casually in jeans and hoodies , stock image in the office and at home are designed to provide ` comfortable ' climate change .
the temperature comes from professor povl ole fanger 's thermal comfort equation from 1970 .
fanger 's equation refers to a unit called the ` clo ' , first developed in 1941 .
