jacksonville jaguars defender jason babin came out of a pileup in a sunday game against arizona , a cardinals running back was slammed after a short run by defensive end jason babin .
he held a fat fistful of andre ellington 's dreadlocks .
babin , 33 , held the hair aloft for a moment like a trophy .
the hair-raising tackle has occurred in the past -- to such tress-sporting players as troy polamalu -- but not in recent memory has the player lost the hair .
