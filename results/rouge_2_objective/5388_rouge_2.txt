wealthy tourists and business travellers visiting the uk could be allowed to skip passport queues by paying a fee to the home office , according to new proposals .
the plan for ` premium fast-track processing ' is one of several proposals outlined yesterday to cover more of the uk border agency by raising cash from foreign visitors .
fast-track processing is already available to some first-class and business-class passengers arriving in the country through heathrow as well as those arriving via private jets .
