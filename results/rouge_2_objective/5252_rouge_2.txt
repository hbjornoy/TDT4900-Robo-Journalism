vladimir putin mobilised more than 150,000 troops and an armada of ships yesterday for a drill to test the combat readiness of forces in western russia as tensions over ukraine continue to grow .
in addition to the soldiers -- nearly twice the british army 's manpower after planned cuts -- 880 tanks , 210 aircraft and 80 warships will take part in the operation .
the manoeuvres raised fears that the russian president may be planning to send forces into ukraine after the toppling of its moscow-backed president viktor yanukovych .
