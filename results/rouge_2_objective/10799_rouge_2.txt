maine was the hardest hit , with much of the central and eastern parts of the state receiving more about a foot of snow .
the snow started falling around 8am sunday morning , and did n't stop until early monday .
most of the snowfall had stopped my noon on monday , 80,000 residents were still without power thanks to 40mph gusts and heavy snow which knocked down trees and power lines .
all of this happened seven weeks ahead of winter , which officially starts december 21 , and pictures posted online monday morning show a strange mix of fall foliage above a thick blanket of snow on the ground .
