cameroonian military has killed abubekar shekau , the leader of nigerian islamist group boko haram - the second time his death has been announced in a week .
cameroonian army officers have claimed they killed the terrorist chief in a fierce battle that ended with them pursuing militants over the border into nigeria .
they released a gruesome photo showing what appeared to be shekau 's dead body .
shekau reportedly uses body doubles to confound his enemies and , although the man in the photo bears a strong resemblance to him , there has been no independent confirmation that cameroon 's forces have killed shekau dozens of times since he rose to the top of boko haram in 2010
