grinning for the camera , the children of the manila slums act like any other youngsters by playing in a paddling pool and even tying rubber bands together to make bracelets .
this is even though they are some of the poorest people in the world .
despite being surrounded by squalor in the makeshift shanty town of tondo in manila , these children ca n't help but smile as they play in the street .
the images of the playful children were taken by belgian photographer sebastien cuvelier on a trip to the philippines .
