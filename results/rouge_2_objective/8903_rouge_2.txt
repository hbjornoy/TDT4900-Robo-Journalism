the german firm has removed the camouflage from its future truck 2025 to reveal even more features , including how the truck 's ` highway pilot ' will scan the road ahead .
in addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track , the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control .
the prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a german autobahn in july , during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck-maker daimler .
