dmitry malyshev , at the kavli institute for particle astrophysics and cosmology in stanford , found that the bubbles have very clear outlines and are fixed at each pole of the milky way .
these ` fermi ' bubbles , which are mostly made up of gamma rays , were discovered four years ago by harvard physicist douglas finkbeiner - and scientists have been trying to explain them ever since .
