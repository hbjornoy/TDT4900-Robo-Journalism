astronauts sunita williams and akihido hoshide were able to construct a make shift tool , proving that just because they are rocket scientists does n't mean they ca n't be handy .
their ingenuity allowed for the installation of a much needed part on the space craft , when williams and hoshide were trying to replace a malfunctioning electrical unit , called a main bus switching unit -lrb- mbsu -rrb- .
there are four 220-pound mbsus on the international space station that are able to harness power from the outpost 's solar arrays .
