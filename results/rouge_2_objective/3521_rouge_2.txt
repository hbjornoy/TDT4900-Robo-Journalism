the town council has been forced to compromise with a new premier inn which called for the chimes of the memorial to be restricted in order to stop guests being disturbed .
instead of sounding off every 15 minutes from 6.15 am the bell will first toll at 8.15 am each day to enable the premier inn to live up to its promise of a great night 's sleep for guests .
premier inn has spent # 6.5 million on the hotel on ashbourne road and brought 30 jobs to the town .
