mexico coach carlos salcido was the biggest surprise in mexico 's 23-man world cup team announced friday by coach miguel herrera .
mexico have announced their 23-man squad for the world cup finals , including javier hernandez and javier aquino of spain 's villarreal .
mexico almost missed out on a sixth consecutive world cup , needing a two-game playoff with new zealand to qualify .
it was the first call-up for salcido since herrera took over as mexico coach late last year .
