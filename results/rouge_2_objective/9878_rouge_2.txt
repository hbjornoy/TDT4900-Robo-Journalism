the hounds pounced on the fox on the a40 in the village of abergwili near carmarthen , south-west wales .
up to ten hunting dogs savaged the animal on the edge of a lay-by , although a bus traveller who took this image of the attack said a hound also died when it was struck by a car .
police were investigating the circumstances surrounding the fox 's death as local hunt organisers distanced themselves from the incident .
