anthony wells , 31 , ` distressed ' the 28-year-old presenter by sending her more than 500 messages over social media - some of which included threats on her life .

he also called her a ` dirty b **** ' and described her as the ` worst piece of s *** that ever lived in this horrid little earth ' the trolling began after miss riley married jamie gilbert , her university sweetheart , in august 2012 .
