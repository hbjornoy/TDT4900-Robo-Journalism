the altona residence in point piper , located just metres back from sydney harbour , will smash the current record for a demolition property by more than $ 20 million if a decision to move the wrecking ball in gets approved next month .
the fate of the 1960s estate is in the hands of sydney 's woollahra council , which will need to assess whether the benefits of building a more contemporary estate on the site outweighs the current property 's heritage listed significance .
the altona mansion in the point piper sold for $ 54 in 2008 and will become sydney 's most expensive property to be demolished if it gets approved in june .
