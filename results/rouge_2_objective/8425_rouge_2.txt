boehner walked away another reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down , but the gop leader did not respond .
obama would implement a 10-point plan to change the immigration system as early as next friday , leading to a renewed effort among house republicans to use an upcoming spending debate to force obama 's hand .
