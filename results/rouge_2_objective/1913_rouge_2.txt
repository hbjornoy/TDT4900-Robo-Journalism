six-time olympic champion sir chris hoy has again been on the sharp end of abuse from disgruntled football fans after chelsea supporters took to social media to vent their fury at referee chris foy .
foy sent off willian and ramires , as well as chelsea manager jose mourinho , in saturday 's 1-0 loss at aston villa as the barclays premier league leaders ' title challenge faltered .
mourinho later called on the premier league to stop sending foy to officiate at chelsea matches .
