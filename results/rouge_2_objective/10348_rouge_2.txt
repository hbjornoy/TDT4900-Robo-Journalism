alex oxlade-chamberlain says he would welcome a place in the england under 21 squad for next summer 's european championship .
the young lions booked their place at the finals following a 4-2 aggregate victory over croatia in a play-off this week and it immediately triggered talk of taking senior stars to the czech republic in june .
there has been much debate over whether full internationals such as oxlade-chamberlain , arsenal team-mates jack wilshere and calum chambers , manchester united 's luke shaw and liverpool 's raheem sterling should ` drop down ' to gareth southgate 's team .
the arsenal forward has played 18 times for england already at the age of just 21 .
