radio station triple m melbourne has come under fire for its lack of diversity in its announcers .
the station tweeted ' @triplemmelb is back at # 1 ' yesterday with a photo of its presenters after the hot breakfast was named most popular in the latest radio ratings .
at first , the picture which included eddie mcguire , mick molloy and luke darcy seemed harmless - until melbourne journalist angela pippos hit out at the picture , pointing out the lack of females at the station .
