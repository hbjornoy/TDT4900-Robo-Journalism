prime minister david cameron has launched an extraordinary attack on rebel mp mark reckless for defecting to ukip , accusing him of betraying activists who worked to get his ` fat arse ' on the commons benches .
the prime minister is furious at the rochester mp 's decision to leave the tory party conference to vow to personally lead the fight to defeat him in the forthcoming by-election .
he insisted he cared 1,000 times more about scotland remaining in the uk than he did about whether britain left the european union , insisting he only wanted to act in the national interest .
