four russian nationals and a ukrainian have been charged with running a sophisticated hacking organization that penetrated computer networks of more than a dozen major american and international corporations over seven years , stealing and selling at least 160 million credit and debit card numbers , resulting in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars .
indictments were announced thursday in newark , where u.s. attorney paul fishman called the case the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the united states .
the indictment did not put a loss figure on the thefts at some other major corporations , including commidea ltd. , a european provider of electronic payment processing for retailers .
