boulder cheops , taken by rosetta 's osiris camera on 19 september , from a distance of 17.7 miles -lrb- 28.5 km -rrb- from earth .
at 82ft-tall -lrb- 25 metres -rrb- , the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history .
esa has now named the structure cheops , after the largest of those pyramids , the great pyramid , which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh cheops around 2550 bc .
the ` pyramid ' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67p/c-g 's larger lobe -- an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at giza
