u.s. researchers found that 87 per cent of women currently remove all or some of their pubic hair , with the majority using a razor , while the rest admitted to getting a bikini wax at least once in their life .
almost two thirds of women surveyed experienced at least one health complication as a result of removing their public hair , such as infections , burns , rashes or cuts .
overweight and obese women were found to be twice as likely to experience a complication than their slimmer counterparts and three times more likely if they removed all of their hair rather than just some of it .
