elie spencer , 47 , and joey reed , 50 , have been charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing $ 100,000 in old-fashioned bills from an elderly widow before blowing most of it in a spending spree .
police said the sudden appearance of old-fashioned $ 100 bills in the small town of gaffney , which were used by the two air conditioning workers to buy a car , lawn mower and television , led to their arrest .
the two maintenance workers have charged with the grand larceny workers after the federal government made anti-forgery changes in 1991 .
