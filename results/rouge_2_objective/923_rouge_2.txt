jose briseon , 51 , had been standing by the sidelines of a bull-run in duenas , in the northern spanish province of palencia , when he decided to throw a bottle of water at the raging animal .
mr briseon can be seen as one of several men taunting the bull , and as he throws the bottle at the animal .
the bull tosses mr briseon up for a second time using his horns , before trampling him under his hooves into the ground .
