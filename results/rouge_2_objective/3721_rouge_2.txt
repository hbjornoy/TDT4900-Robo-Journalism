prince harry has finally arrived in antarctica ahead of the charity trek involving wounded servicemen and women after the trip was delayed for 48 hours .
the group was forced to stay over in cape town this week as a storm in the south pole meant flights had to be cancelled .
they were met by temperatures of around minus 3c - cooler than they enjoyed in south africa - but will face icy lows of up to minus 45c and biting 50mph winds on the trek itself .
