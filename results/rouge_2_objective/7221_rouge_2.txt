emma dickson , of edinburgh , thought she would be planning her wedding to her fiance dougie , 26 .
the 31-year-old had two blood clots in her lungs , which led to a condition which caused her left lung to collapse - just a month before she was due to get married .
doctors told her she had developed blood clots which can be caused by the synthetic hormones in the contraceptive pill , that then moved to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism .
she will now have to take blood-thinning medication for the rest of her life which have caused her hair to fall out and severe headaches .
