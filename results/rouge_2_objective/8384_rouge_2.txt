abu bakr al-baghdadi , the elusive leader of the al qaeda splinter group islamic state of iraq and sham -lrb- isis -rrb- , walked out of the shadows and delivered a sermon at the great mosque in mosul , iraq 's second largest city .
he addressed the packed congregation -- which included isis fighters and local sympathisers -- on the first friday of the muslim holy month of ramadan , in the heart of a city his fighters took control of barely a month ago .
he also declared large swathes of northern syria and iraq seized by his fighters as his new caliphate .
