the rusty bronze fragments of the antikythera mechanism , the world 's oldest computer , are 100 years older than scientists previously thought .
this is according to argentinian researchers who found that an eclipse prediction calendar - a dial on the back of the mechanism - includes a solar eclipse that happened on may 12 , 205 b.c. previous radiocarbon dating analysis of the remarkable mechanism had provided a later construction date of around 100 to 150 bc .
the study , by the national university of quilmes , suggests that the process in which the computer predicts eclipses is babylonian arithmetic , rather greek trigonometry .
