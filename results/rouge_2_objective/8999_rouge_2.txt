nigel farage could see himself in government after the next election according to a mail on sunday , carried out after ukip rocked the tories and labour in two by-elections last week .
if the poll result was repeated in next year 's general election , it would see the tories lose 100 seats , the certain resignation of david cameron -- and the possibility of ed miliband in no10 .
the tories , under david cameron could lose up to 100 seats as voters turn towards ukip in mass numbers .
the collapse could see ed miliband handed the keys to number 10 unless cameron does a deal with farage .
