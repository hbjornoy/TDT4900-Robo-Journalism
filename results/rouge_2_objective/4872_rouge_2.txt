imam feisal abdul rauf was slapped with a $ 20 million lawsuit by , robert leslie deak , a major backer to his nonprofit who alleges the wild spending in the papers filed in manhattan supreme court .
rauf 's charity , the cordoba initiative , received $ 3 million from the malaysian as well as another $ 167,000 from private donors .
the mosque drew criticism from family members of those who died on 9/11 because it is just two blocks from the site of the terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 .
imam 's lawyer adamantly denied the allegations , the new york post reported that rauf ` falsified ' the nonprofit 's ` tax returns for 2008
