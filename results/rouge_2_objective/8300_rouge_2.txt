power cut has left three fuel storage pools at japan 's tsunami-damaged nuclear plant without fresh cooling water for nearly 24 hours , raising concerns about the fragility of the tsunami-ravaged nuclear plant .
the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear plant 's operator said the temperatures in the pools was within safe limits and would remain so for four days , but the incident has highlighted the problems caused by the continued use of makeshift equipment at the damaged plant .
a spokesman for tokyo electric power company said the reactors were not affected by the power outage and said staff were preparing a back-up system in case the repairs did not fix the problem .
