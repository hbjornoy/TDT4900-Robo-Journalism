crowds had already started to gather by the port of keelung in the north of taiwan today when tragedy struck ... the 50ft giant inflatable duck , due to take part in new year 's eve festivities mere hours later , inexplicably burst .
one theory is that the giant duck , designed by dutch artist florentijn hofman to be a giant version of the popular bath toy - burst today while it was attacked by eagles .
the cause of the deflation , which was caught on display there for 11 days , only to explode at around noon - hours before large crowds were expected to gather to welcome 2014 .
