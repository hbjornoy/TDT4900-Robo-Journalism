oratilwe hlongwane , whose dj name is aj , is still learning to put together words but the toddler is already able to play music from a laptop and has become a phenomenon in south africa .
the youngster , who still wears nappies and does not yet go to school , plays bass-heavy house music on dj decks after teaching himself how to select and play music with an disc jockey app on his father 's ipad .
his mother , refiloe marumo , credits his astounding success on the decks to his father glen hlongwane 's decision to buy an ipad for his then unborn son .
