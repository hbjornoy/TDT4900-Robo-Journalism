obama administration quietly announced on tuesday that it intends to change the way americans learn about natural disasters and other major emergencies during radio and tv broadcasts .
the emergency alert system , the latest version of a program first established in 1951 , blasts out emergency messages in the event of local weather emergencies , but can also be used to warn americans about terror attacks and major natural disasters .
it can take up to 10 minutes for every radio , tv , cable and satellite provider to blare its alert .
