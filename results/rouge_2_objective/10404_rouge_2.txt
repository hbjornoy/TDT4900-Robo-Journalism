rosie paley , 19 , woke up in hospital every memory of her childhood , and even forgot her favourite foods , bands and the fact she knew how to ride a horse .
the teenager , from brierley hill , west midlands , was 16 when she developed encephalitis , which causes inflammation of the brain .
rosie can now recognise her mother helen , 36 , and her brothers rhys , four , but she has relied on photographs , stories and childhood toys for help .
