the brazilian contestants sashayed onto the stage in pink bikinis for a beauty pageant held in rio de janeiro 's jo√£o caetano theatre , their incredible figures drew a loud applause and cheers from a hyped up , excited audience .
the wolf-whistles and shouts of appreciation were not just for the models ' feminine curves ; they are also for the breathtaking courage of the leggy , high cheeked sirens , who in flaunting their bodies made an unequivocal statement that they are proud to be transvestites and transsexuals .
the prize was worth # 4,000 with a year of counseling if they choose the sex operation .
