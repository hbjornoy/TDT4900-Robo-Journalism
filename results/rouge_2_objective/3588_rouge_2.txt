the bill for winter fuel payments to british pensioners living abroad has soared by 70 per cent in a year , thanks to a european court ruling .
as millions of elderly people in the uk face a cold winter and inflation-busting rises to their energy bills , it was revealed that a record # 21million was paid last year to expats living in sunnier climes such as spain , cyprus and france in the last year .
the bill soared from # 12.8 million in 2011/12 after judges ruled that anyone with a ` sufficient link ' to britain could claim the # 200 - # 300 allowance .
