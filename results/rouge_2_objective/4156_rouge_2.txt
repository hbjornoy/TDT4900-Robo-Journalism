woody the bedlington terrier was only discovered when his owner 's neighbour opened the bonnet of his vauxhall corsa to find a white furry face looking out from beside the engine .
his master mike tracey , 52 , said : ` we thought about using a jack to try and get him out but we were worried about something going wrong .
they were eventually forced to call the plymouth fire brigade to release the three-year-old dog -- who was covered in oil but did n't sustain any injuries during his mini-ordeal and was right as rain after a good bath .
woody may need a bit longer to deal with the embarrassment after his unique ordeal .
