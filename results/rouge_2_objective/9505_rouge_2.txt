the unnamed woman , believed to be in her 80s , had used the free shuttle service which takes patients with dementia from their homes to day care services .
staff on board the bus forgot to ensure she got off the vehicle and she remained locked inside when it returned to the middlefields depot in south shields , south tyneside .
the vehicle is thought to have been parked up at the depot by a worker from charity alzheimer 's society at around 4pm and the woman was discovered at 6.30 pm .
