specialist materials group james cropper has been producing the biodegradable paper since 1978 , when the royal british legion stopped using fabric .
every year 155 miles -lrb- 250km -rrb- of red paper is produced in burneside , cumbria , which is then turned into more than 50million remembrance poppies .
the firm , overseen by the cropper family 's sixth generation , has taken colour samples from real poppy petals to make the paper close to the real thing .
