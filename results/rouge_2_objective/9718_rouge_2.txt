the party , under ed miliband leadership , is back at 29 per cent in the polls , trailing the conservatives on 30 per cent , according to a survey released by lord ashcroft this afternoon .
among labour supporters , 19 per cent are dissatisfied with mr cameron but would still prefer him as prime minister than mr miliband after the next election .
the poll comes amid growing concern in the labour party over its dramatic slump in scotland , which one survey suggested could see mr miliband lose almost 40 seats north of the border .
