leslie neil cunliffe , 63 , will be deported from australia to the uk , officials confirmed today .
cunliffe posed as a policeman to kidnap a 21-year-old woman , then gagged , blindfolded and bound her .
he demanded a one million australian dollar ransom from her family during the may 1999 attack in geelong , near melbourne .
australian authorities have cancelled his visa on ` character ' grounds under a provision in their immigration act that allows them to expel people convicted of serious offences .
