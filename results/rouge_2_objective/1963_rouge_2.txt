locals in warminster town , wiltshire , took photographs of the bird as it fled having avoided the attempts of several women who tried to keep it under control .
the giant rhea burst past its owner and went running down a busy main road causing bemusement , just six weeks after it escaped yesterday afternoon bringing traffic in warminster to a standstill .
police spent three hours chasing the flightless bird before it was cornered allowing the owner to safely collect it .
