incredible images show officers paul watts and simon russell rescuing the petrified 63-year-old woman from the car , which was rapidly sinking into waitemata harbour in auckland at 3pm on tuesday .
watts modestly described the dramatic rescue as ` pretty much part of a routine job being a police officer ' , saying the whole rescue only took about 40 seconds - and that 40 seconds later the car completely vanished beneath the water .
the courageous officers received a call from new zealand police commissioner mike bush on tuesday afternoon to commend them on their efforts .
