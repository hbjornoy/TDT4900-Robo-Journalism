bayern munich squad flew back to germany on thursday the day after suffering a surprise defeat by porto in the champions league quarter-final first leg .
a glum-looking thomas muller , manuel neuer and pep guardiola were pictured at the airport ready to board their flight back to bavaria after their 3-1 loss at the estadio dragao on wednesday .
the defeat was the price the five-time european champions paid for a string of injuries and a tired squad that has not stopped playing , chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge said .
bayern have been cruising towards the bundesliga title with a 10-point advantage as the injuries seem to hardly affect them domestically .
