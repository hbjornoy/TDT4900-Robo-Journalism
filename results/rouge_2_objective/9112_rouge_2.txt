derek warwick , the british steward who cleared nico rosberg of cheating at the monaco grand prix , has urged lewis hamilton to ` man up ' over the decision and move on .
hamilton was angry that rosberg slithered off the track at the mirabeau corner in the dying minutes of qualifying .
rosberg went on to win the race , with hamilton insinuating afterwards that data he saw showed his mercedes team-mate had acted deliberately .
rosberg was unimpressed by the british racing drivers ' club , silverstone 's owners , and a veteran of 146 formula one races .
