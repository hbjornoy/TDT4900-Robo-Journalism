qpr striker charlie austin and tottenham talisman harry kane are on the verge of a sensational call up for the england squad .
austin , who has scored five times for rangers this season , is being monitored by england head coach roy hodgson and his scouts .
the rangers forward , who scored against chelsea in the 2-1 defeat last weekend , narrowly missed out on a place in the squad for the game with slovenia -lrb- november 15 -rrb- and scotland -lrb- november 18 -rrb- and has already scored 10 times this season .
