the family of 14 walked out of a remote community declaring they had been living in the gloriavale christian community in haupiri - on new zealand 's west coast - have moved 200 miles away to live with a ` normal ' family as they begin reintegrating into society , the new zealand herald reports .
gloriavale , which was established about 45 years ago , does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children .
the population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control .
