the cia commissioned howard hughes to construct a massive vessel to recover a soviet submarine that sank in the pacific ocean in 1968 .
some 200 pages on project azorian , one of the most complex , and secretive intelligence operations of the cold war , reveal previously unknown details of the aborted plan .
the soviets tried for two months to recover the sub , but the attempts were fruitless .
hughes 's vessel , the hughes glomar explorer , embarked on a salvage mission in 1974 which was leaked to the u.s. because it would enable officials to examine the design of soviet nuclear warheads and decipher soviet naval codes .
