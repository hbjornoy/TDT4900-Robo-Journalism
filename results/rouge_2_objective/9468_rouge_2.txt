new research has found women are more likely to make women hot under the collar by switching on a blender than turning on a power tool , according to new research .
a team of neuroscientists were flown in from london to conduct scientific testing on 20 australian couples to determine what domestic duties aroused women the most .
while their male partners were performing activities from traditional do-it-yourself tasks and drilling to cake mixing , coffee-making and blending , their female counterparts had their mental , emotional and physiological responses monitored .
the research also showed that seven out of 10 women likened receiving a home-made coffee from their partner to receiving a gift or a loving embrace .
