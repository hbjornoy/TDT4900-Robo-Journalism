the summer palace of shah jahan , the fifth mughal emperor of india , has been unearthed at a 500-year-old garden opposite the taj mahal .
archaeologists suspect the latest discovery is a palace ` baradari ' - a pavilion with 12 doors designed to allow free flow of air .
the garden where it was found , known as mehtab bagh , was thought to a favourite spot for the emperor to gaze up at the night .
archaeologists have also suggested that the blackened marbles in mehtab bagh that lie on the other side of the river are in fact foundations of an abandoned plan for the black taj .
