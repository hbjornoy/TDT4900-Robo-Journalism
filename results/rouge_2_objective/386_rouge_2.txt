royal mail is to cut the price of sending small parcels in the run up to christmas , saving consumers up to # 5.20 per package .
the promotion will last from october 20 to january 18 , allowing families and businesses to make savings by sending larger items at a reduced rate , and cramming more into a single package than they would have been able to previously .
the size of a ` small ' parcel will effectively double to 2kg , at a cost of # 2.80 .
