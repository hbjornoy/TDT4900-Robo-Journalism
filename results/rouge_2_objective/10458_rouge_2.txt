ole gunnar solskjaer has left cardiff city by mutual consent , bringing an end to a hugely underwhelming spell at the club for the norwegian .
the final straw , on the back of last season 's relegation , was tuesday 's 1-0 home defeat against middlesbrough , which left cardiff 17th in the championship .
solskjaer was called to london on wednesday morning for lengthy talks with chairman mehmet dalman who has not been approached by cardiff .
