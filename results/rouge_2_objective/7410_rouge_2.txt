sophie anderson was a healthy 11-year-old primary school pupil who ` loved her food ' but then her family received a letter warning that she was ` at risk of being overweight ' she was only saved after being force-fed through a tube in hospital .
the once fun-loving schoolgirl became anorexic , and increasingly withdrew from her family as her weight fell to less than four stone .
the norfolk teenager , who appeared on itv 's daybreak programme yesterday , said all the children at her school compared the letters and talked about it in class which only made things worse .
