the seafront town of tossa de mar is so fed up with drunken and scantily-clad tourists from britain and other countries that it has banned stag and hen dos during the month of the year .
local authorities say the new rules are aimed at party planners -- not individual groups of visitors -- who organise booze cruises , treasure hunts and other events for tourists ' stag .
the town is taking action after locals complained about drunken partygoers urinating in the street and singing loudly in the town 's squares in the early morning hours .
