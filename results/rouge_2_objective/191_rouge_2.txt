arsenal captain thomas vermaelen might be on a holiday from football , but he still found time for a kick-about on the beach in barbados .
the belgian centre-back , enjoying a break with his family between the world cup and the new premier league season , showed off his skills by the sea .
vermaelen was a teammate of van persie at arsenal , and could be again at manchester united .
the dutch captain spent time with vermaelen for the second day running on friday , as his club teammates flew to america on a pre-season tour .
