queen anne founded the royal ascot in 1711 , the monarch , accompanied by prince philip in the horse-drawn royal carriage , led a procession from windsor castle to the berkshire race course this afternoon .
the queen , whose choice of hat colour is always the subject of frenzied bets , looked immaculate as ever in a powder blue dress and coat by stewart parvin .
the colour would have come to no surprise to royal fashion watchers , who recently found that the queen last year chose to wear blue on 29 per cent of her public engagements - three times as often as she wore any other colour .
