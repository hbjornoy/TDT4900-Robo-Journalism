serena williams and maria sharapova each completed demolition jobs on thursday .
the pair lost just five games , won 108 points out of 165 , and spent no more than one hour and 49 minutes on court no 1 , almost as if neither much fancied exposing their bodies to the summer chill for very long .
williams was quicker , beating chanelle scheepers 6-1 , 6-1 in 49 minutes -- the third shortest time at 8.59 pm .
sharapova is made to work for a point but ran out a very comfortable winner .
