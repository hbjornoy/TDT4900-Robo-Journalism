indonesian ` airasia ' airline had been promoting their new route for months , promising to fly passengers directly from melbourne to bali after a december 26 launch .
they sent out frantic texts on christmas day to passengers , informing them that flights from boxing day onwards were not only cancelled , but their expected travel time on their new flights was doubled from five-and-a-half hours to a lengthy 13 hours .
weddings and travel plans went out the window when the commuters were informed they would now stop over at kuala lumpur , meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned .
airasia x have cancelled their flights with just a day 's notice
