tess guthrie , 22 , from the town of lismore in northern new south wales , stands in the room where the pair were fast asleep until the family cat alerted them to the danger .
mrs guthrie threw herself at the snake , grabbing it by the head and tried to pry it off her two-year-old daughter , who had been sleeping beside her mother .
the snake fought back and sank its fangs three times into zara 's hand .
