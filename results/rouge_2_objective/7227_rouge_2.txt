mayak caberet is one of the last gay clubs in sochi , russia .
club owner roman kochagov told reuters that on any given night , only a third of his customers are gay men , far fewer than when he opened the club nine years ago .
the gay community in sochi has mostly fled the seaside resort since russia won the right to host the 2014 winter games .
