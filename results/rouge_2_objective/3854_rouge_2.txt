boko haram fighters attacked the north cameroon town of fotokol on tuesday until they were driven out by cameroon and chad forces at a mosque on tuesday .
many of the dead were found with their throats slit , according to a local newspaper .
the raid comes amid a major offensive by its neighbouring african states against boko haram , which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in nigeria and begun to mount increasingly bloody cross-border raids .
the sunni muslim jihadist group is seen as the main security threat to nigeria , africa 's biggest economy and top oil producer which will hold a presidential election on february 14 .
