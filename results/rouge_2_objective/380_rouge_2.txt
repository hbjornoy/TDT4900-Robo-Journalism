british scientists have captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm , by studying the blue fluorescence that travels cell-to-cell until the whole organism is dead .
researchers from the wellcome trust and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- likened the spread of the blue glow travelling through the worm 's body to that of the grim reaper , stalking death .
they believe the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people and perhaps even lead to an increase in life expectancy .
