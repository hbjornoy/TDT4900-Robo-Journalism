researchers in london have created a new technology that uses sound , such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop , to charge up mobile phones .
the invention was inspired by previous research at queen mary university of london -lrb- qmul -rrb- , which found playing pop and rock music improved the performance of solar cells .
their prototype device , which is about the size of a mobile phone , uses zinc oxide to convert vibrations caused by sound into electricity .
