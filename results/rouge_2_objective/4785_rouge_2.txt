the cyclist shot dead in the alps may have been the ` main target ' of the massacre , french police say -- not the british al-hilli family .
investigators made the extraordinary claim as sylvain mollier , who worked in the nuclear industry , was ` temporarily buried ' in a secret ceremony yesterday .
just 30 people attended the funeral , which took place at 6.30 pm last night - a day when the burial site is normally closed .
