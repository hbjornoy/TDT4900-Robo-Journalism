the syrian army on monday lost control of two strategic bases in the northwestern province of idlib to co-ordinated assaults by al qaeda and other islamist groups .
the syrian observatory for human rights said the al-nusra front , an al qaeda affiliate , seized hamidiyeh and wadi al-deif bases in tandem with islamist rebels from jund al-aqsa and ahrar al-sham .
at least 31 government soldiers and 12 opposition fighters have been killed in clashes since sunday .
