the u.s. senate urged nfl commissioner roger goodell on thursday to change the washington redskins ' name to ban los angeles clippers owner donald sterling for life after he was heard on an audio recording making offensive comments about blacks .
the redskins name has inspired merchandise , a team song , and hundreds of thousands of loyal fans .
they said goodell should formally push to rename the redskins .
the franchise has been known as the redskins since 1933 , when it played in boston .
