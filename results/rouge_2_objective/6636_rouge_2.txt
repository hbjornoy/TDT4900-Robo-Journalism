the brookhaven national laboratory 's realistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- accelerates nuclei to the speed of light , before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma , which is an incredibly hot substance thought to have occurred just after the big bang .
scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment using a super-charged ion collider could accidentally destroy planet earth .
the brookhaven will be able to generate collisions 20 times stronger than when it was originally built , prompting legal experts to question whether the facility also needs to perform a more thorough risk assessment .
