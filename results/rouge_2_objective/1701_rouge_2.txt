cardiff city have asked to take manchester united midfielder michael keane on loan but louis van gaal will wait to see if the club make progress on new defensive recruitments before allowing him out .
the gunners wanted chris smalling to go in the other direction for vermaelen 's switch to go through , something van gaal is keen to strengthen his back-line at old trafford before approving the move , particularly after united missed out on signing thomas vermaelen from arsenal .
blackburn are also interest in a temporary deal for keane , who spent the second half of last season on loan at ewood park .
