daniel munns , a lincoln university graduate , travelled to the cambridgeshire station with a phantom 2 dji drone and spent an hour filming and an additional nine hours editing once home .
he was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives and after purchasing a drone believed the station would be an interesting place in which to capture some unique footage .
the video itself is both chilling and captures the abandonment of the deterioration that has taken place since the base was closed .
daniel was only testing his gopro camera and drone but was ecstatic with the final product .
