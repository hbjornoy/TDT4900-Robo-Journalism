dozens of soldiers in the wachbataillon unit -lrb- guard battalion -rrb- , which performs drill displays at official events , have complained about over-developed breasts on their left-hand side because of the way they clasp their rifles .
it is understood the repeated slapping of their rifles against their chests has stimulated hormones , causing a condition known as one-sided gynecomastia .
the wachbataillon is the largest battalion of the german forces with about 1,800 soldiers , split between garrisons in berlin and siegburg .
