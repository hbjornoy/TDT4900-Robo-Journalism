sullivan , 39 , walked the once popular coastal route in maui during the summer of 2013 of 2013 and is currently running a kickstarter campaign to fund a book of 100 pictures of the trail entitled the maui coast - legacy of the king 's highway .
he crossed sheer cliffs , battled white water and dense jungle to uncover the amazing island scenery of the highway , which was built over 500 years ago by king pi'ilani who ruled the island during the 16th century .
the hui aloha church in kipahulu stands out like a beacon along the train , the white building among the bright green foliage among them .
