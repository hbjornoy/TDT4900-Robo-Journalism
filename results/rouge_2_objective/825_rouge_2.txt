joseph banks , 37 , had been on the run with prison mate kenneth conley , 38 , after the two escaped on tuesday , descending a 20 story drop from a window of the metropolitan correctional center .
the two men apparently descended from a thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison into the alley below .
the wall faces a parking garage and is above air conditioning or heating units .
