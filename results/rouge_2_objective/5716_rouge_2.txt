fellow nfl stars tim tebow and tom brady worried about aaron hernandez 's behavior as early as 2011 , according to a newly surfaced video .
brady went as far as to describe the former new england patriorts star , who was arrested last month for murder , as ' a lot to handle , ' in the footage from nfl films .
brady has swapped his $ 1.3 m mansion for a 7ft by 10ft grim prison cell where the other inmates think he is from week 15 of the nfl season in denver , when brady 's new england patriots defeated the tebow-led denver broncos 41-23 .
