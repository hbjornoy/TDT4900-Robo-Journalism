simon ward , 42 , a property developer from the north of england , flew to the greek island of kos when police from south yorkshire started digging there in october , searching for the remains of ben needham , who vanished in july 1991 aged just 21 months .
he told the daily mirror how he dressed in clothes similar to police so he could watch the dig undisturbed as it unfolded , as well as about the painful mix of emotions he endured as he watched what could have been the final resting place of his beloved son .
he would be around 23 years-old now .
