new app from ikea could save consumers from hacking lumps out of bookcases or sheepishly taking back extra large items to the swedish superstore as it uses augmented reality technology to show consumers what a piece of furniture would look like in their home .
the free app will be available in the apple app store and google play and uses the old-fashioned paper ikea catalogue to judge the approximate scale of the furnishings .
