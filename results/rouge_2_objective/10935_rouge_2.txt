two mosquito-borne diseases - dengue fever and chikungunya - are posing a serious threat to florida and residents should take steps to control mosquito populations to try to limit the danger .
all of the infected people in florida have traveled to the caribbean or south america and could have become infected there , according to walter tabachnick , director of the florida medical entomological laboratory in vero beach , which is part of the university of florida .
epidemiologists are worried that mosquitoes in florida may have picked up the diseases by biting infected people , which could kick off an epidemic in the state .
