the national park service late monday confirmed that the large cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in half moon bay , 400 miles northwest of the mojave desert where it was stolen from its california desert perch two years ago mysteriously turned up hundreds of miles away in the san francisco bay area .
a local sheriff 's department was notified monday that the cross found in san mateo county is the same mojave memorial cross that went missing in 2010 .
the cross had been encased in a wooden box as a result of a decade-long legal battle over its existence between the vfw and the american civil liberties union .
