frank ` perk ' hixon , jr , 55 , who is due to be sentenced friday , told the judge that his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter was ` too proud ' to accept money - but apparently happily accepted investment advice .
hixon was also charged with using inside information to trade in his father 's account .
hixon 's crimes ` pale in comparison to the pervasive , calculated and economically-driven conduct of defendants such as raj rajaratnam , ' william f. johnson argued .
he pleaded guilty to five counts of securities fraud and one count of making false statements to federal agents for crimes that occurred between october 2011 and january 2013 .
