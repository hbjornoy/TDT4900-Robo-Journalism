jenna talackova , 23 , was thrown out of the pageant , founded by donald trump , when organisers found out she had undergone surgery to become a woman .
officials denied charges of discrimination and said the reason why a male-to-female transgender contestant could not compete was because miss talackova lied on her application form .
the transgendered contestant had already successfully reached the finals in the miss vancouver pageant before she was banned from continuing in the competition .
