jose barrera said the picture on google earth shows his son kevin , who was found battered and shot to death beside train tracks in richmond , california four years ago .
the body of 14-year-old kevin barrera can be seen on the ground with a police car parked nearby and officers standing close to his body .
he is now asking the internet giant to take down the image out of respect and said he plans to lodge a complaint if they fail to do so .
google has yet to respond to mailonline 's request for a comment .
