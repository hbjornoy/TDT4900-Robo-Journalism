the gigantic drill , known as bertha , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000 ft of its two-mile journey to replace the aging alaska way , which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake .
its stalling left crews working on the $ 80million project scrambling to determine how to rescue and repair the five-storey , 2,000-ton drill .
now managers of the project are preparing to show off the cutting head as the refurbishment takes place .
