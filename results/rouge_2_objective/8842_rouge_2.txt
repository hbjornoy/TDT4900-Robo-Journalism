the state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a # 446million loss for the first three months of the year .
it comes after rbs was forced to put aside # 856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided , including an extra # 334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks .
the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time for chancellor george osborne , six days before the general election .
