mach , ashura and cosmo form z-machines - a three-piece rock band made up of robots - and they made for a scary sight while performing at an art and technology event in tokyo , japan .
the group , who made their debut live performance in july , were created by a group of engineers and academics at tokyo university , who hope they will one day be able to perform in space .
the guitarist has 21 sticks and six arms - and the keyboard player can flash multi-layered beams from its eyes .
