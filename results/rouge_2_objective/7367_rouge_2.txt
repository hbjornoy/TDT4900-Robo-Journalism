dafydd morris from caernarfon , gwynedd , has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600-acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain .
the 76-year-old , who still farms the land , bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill-farming .
mr morris said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600-acres .
