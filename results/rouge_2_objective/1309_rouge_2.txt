then-12-year-old dennis komsa wrote a note on a piece of paper , put it in a glass mason jar and hurled it into the atlantic ocean near sampson avenue in seaside heights , new jersey , hoping it would some day be returned to him .
the bottle was found by norman stanton about a week after hurricane sandy devastated the new jersey coast - nearly 50 years after it was found a quarter of a mile away from where komsa had thrown it in .
