bradford co-chairman mark lawn is backing his fa cup heroes to beat either sunderland or fulham in the competition 's fifth round .
monday 's draw pitched chelsea 's unlikely conquerors into a home tie with either gus poyet 's premier league black cats or kit symons ' championship side , who are due to replay next week after a 0-0 draw on saturday .
bradford fans were hoping for a tie with arsenal or manchester united , a home clash will be welcomed and lawn is of the opinion that neither sunderland nor fulham will fancy the trip to west yorkshire on the weekend of february 14/15 .
