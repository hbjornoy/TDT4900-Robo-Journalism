president barack obama quietly ended a controversial program on thursday that had deported 283,000 of them after they were arrested for crimes other than border-crossing .
the secure communities program has been in place in limited form since 2006 , and expanded nationwide in 2008 .
only illegal immigrants convicted of felonies and other serious crimes will be handed over to immigration authorities , homeland security secretary jeh johnson announced thursday .
the administration has replaced it with a much narrower program that limits the list of qualifying offenses and only lets the immigration and customs enforcement agency intervene after an illegal immigrant is convicted .
