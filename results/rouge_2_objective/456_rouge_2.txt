psychologists have found that giving small electric shocks to volunteers was enough to distort their memories of things they had seen in the past .
brian williams , the former nbc nightly news anchor , also suggested his own memory may have been affected in a similar way while covering the war in iraq in 2003 due to his fear at being in a warzone for the first time .
the findings will increase concerns about the reliability of eyewitness accounts during court cases from people who have suffered traumatic experiences .
