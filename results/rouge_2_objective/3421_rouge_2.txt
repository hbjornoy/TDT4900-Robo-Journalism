canadian nick taylor picked up his first win on the pga tour on sunday as he won the sanderson farms championship .
the 26-year-old from winnipeg - in his first season on the tour - finished two shots clear of the field in just his 13th full-time start and he becomes the first man from his country win on tour since stephen ames five years ago .
he dropped three shots coming home on 12,14 and 18 , losing his game when he needed it the most after a level front nine .
england 's greg owen was the highest-placed european , ending nine shy of taylor in a tie for 22nd .
