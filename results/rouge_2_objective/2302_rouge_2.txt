burglars targeted the heavily guarded building site site which has been hit by several setbacks since construction began in the heart of the german capital nine years ago .
they ripped out water taps from bathrooms on the fourth , fifth and sixth floors in a passageway leading to the main part of the sprawling complex early tuesday .
the motive was unclear as the taps are only thought to be worth a few hundred euros .
the site is guarded by a private firm and monitored by dozens of security cameras .
