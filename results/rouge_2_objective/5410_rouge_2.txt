sergeant major harry gurung , 45 , sneezed four to five times as he overtook a car at 74mph on his way back to his barracks .
he was accused of killing pensioners david and mary marshall when he clipped the rear of their ford ka - but a top expert on the common cold supported his claim that sneezes could be to blame .
professor ronald eccles , director of britain 's common cold centre , said it was ` impossible ' for people to sneeze with their eyes open .
