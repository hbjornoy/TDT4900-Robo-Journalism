dr nikki gammans , of the short-haired bumblebee project , said : ` it 's not a doom and gloom scenario .
we can actually reverse this trend ' pesticides have been blamed for killing off many bumblebees , as has the loss of 97per cent of the uk 's wild flower meadows since the 1930s due to agricultural intensification and urbanisation .
bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth # 560m a year to the uk economy .
seven of the country 's 25 bumblebee species are now considered threatened enough to be in the uk biodiversity action plan .
