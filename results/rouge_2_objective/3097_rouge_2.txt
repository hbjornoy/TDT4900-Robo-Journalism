seven-year-old polar bear giovanna gave birth to her twins two days ago in the birthing den at the hellabrunn zoo in munich , germany , on monday .
they are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in europe this year and , incredibly , their mother positioned herself in the direct view of cctv cameras set up to record the moment .
the tiny twins are the first time such a birth has been filmed in colour .
