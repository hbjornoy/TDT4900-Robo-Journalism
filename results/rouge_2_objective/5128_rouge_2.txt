henrik stenson was angry with tournament officials after two late mistakes cost him victory in the arnold palmer invitational at bay hill on sunday .
stenson had seen his two-shot overnight lead turned into a two-shot deficit in the space of eight holes , but fought back to reclaim the outright lead with six holes of the final round to play .
the ryder cup star - who had played the final four holes in four under par on friday and saturday - three-putted the 15th for a bogey and did the same for par on the 16th after finding the green in two .
