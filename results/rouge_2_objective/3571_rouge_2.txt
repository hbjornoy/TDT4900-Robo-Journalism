petition calling on the network a&e to reinstate phil robertson on the hit reality show duck dynasty has now met - and surpassed - its target of 250,000 signatures .
the petition is being spearheaded by the christian conservative group faith driven consumer , which is also behind the site istandwithphil.com .
he had been suspended indefinitely for making homophobic and racially charged remarks during an interview with gq magazine .
a&e is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour duck dynasty marathon in spite of star phil robertson 's anti-gay tirade .
