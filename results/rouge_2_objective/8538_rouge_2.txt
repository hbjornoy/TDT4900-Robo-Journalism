shabana ansari is the 32-year-old widow of mr khan who would likely be entitled to his property because he reportedly had no will at the time of his death .
mr khan 's brother imtiaz fears the victim 's teenage daughter from a previous marriage is n't going to get ` her fair share ' of his $ 1million jackpot because he had been buried .
ms ansari 's attorney al-haroon husain , who is representing her in the probate case dealing with the lottery winnings , told the chicago tribune that the funds are in the process of being equitably divided between the teenage daughter and ms ansari .
