the extremely rare 18th century ornament made for a chinese emperor , was brought to britain by the seller 's family more than a century ago .
despite it standing just 20cm -lrb- eight inches -rrb- high , an anonymous telephone buyer from china paid around 100 times its estimated value when it went under the hammer at tennants ' auction rooms in leyburn , north yorkshire today .
tennants ' associate director , nigel smith said the blue and white bottle vase , made for the qianlong emperor around 1730 , was put up for sale by an academic who lives in oxford .
