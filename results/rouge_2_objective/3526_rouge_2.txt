talkback host tom elliott was led to believe he was talking to australian rapper 360 on his 3aw radio show on monday - while the legitimate artist was filming himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his facebook page .
elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a kurdish man , living in scandinavia , pretended to be isis commander omar al-shishani during a phone interview in august .
the melbourne radio host thought he was not speaking with the real 360 .
