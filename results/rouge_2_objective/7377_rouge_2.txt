ed miliband has been caught up in a furious labour row over plans to let scotland decide its own abortion laws .
the proposal is outlined in the cross-party smith commission report on devolving powers to edinburgh drawn up in the wake of the ` no ' vote in september 's referendum on scottish independence .
senior frontbencher maria eagle , who has opposed a reduction in the abortion time limit , led calls for the proposals to be thrown out .
witnesses said the shadow environment secretary banged the table and hit out at the male-dominated commission who were drawing up the plans .
