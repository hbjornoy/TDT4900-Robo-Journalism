republican-controlled house has passed a one-week funding extension for homeland security after the majority refused to pass the legislation just hours before the deadline .
lawmakers were thrown into a race against time on friday night when 52 republicans defected on the leadership-backed legislation .
the first group was upset because the legislation had been stripped of changes to president barack obama 's immigration policy , and the second because it lacked full-year funding for the sprawling department .
the house voted 357 to 60 to fund the department for another week .
