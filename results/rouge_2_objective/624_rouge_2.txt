state capitols across the country will be more republican than at any point since the roaring '20s when victorious legislators and governors take office next year .
in some states , such as kansas , republicans will be able to do as they want , because they control both chambers of the legislature and the governor 's office .
the gop will hold at least 32 governorships , including newly won offices in traditionally democratic illinois , maryland and massachusetts .
