manchester united are attempting to return to the summit of the premier league with the most expensive squad ever assembled in the english game .
the arrival of angel di maria this week takes the combined transfer fees of the united squad to an eye-watering # 401.2 million - and that figure could grow with new signings before the transfer window closes .
the value of united 's squad now outstrips their neighbours and defending champions manchester city , who are worth a collective # 344.15 m when the transfer fees are added up .
