jordan henderson is not ready to give up on liverpool 's champions league hopes despite an eight-point gap to manchester united in fourth place .
the 24-year-old scored a penalty at the emirates on saturday , but it was not enough as liverpool fell to a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of arsenal to leave their top-four hopes in tatters .
henderson is targeting seven wins out of seven in the league and an immediate response at blackburn .
