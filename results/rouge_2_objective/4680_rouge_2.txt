veronica smith , from east sussex , fell in love with her daughter , catherine , the second she was laid in her arms .
her happiness was not to last because veronica , then 24 , was an unmarried mother brought up in a catholic family in an era that frowned on unwed parents .
veronica says she hopes the british government will follow the example of australia and offer an apology to women whose children were taken away and adopted by others in the 1960s .
