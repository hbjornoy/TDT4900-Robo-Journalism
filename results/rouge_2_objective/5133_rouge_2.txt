tories want to change the law to allow humanist weddings , for couples who do not want a religious or civil marriage to express their commitment .
tories say such an amendment would ` dilute ' the institution of marriage by allowing other ` ridiculous ' sects to marry couples .
in scotland there were 2,400 humanist weddings last year , outnumbering catholic ceremonies .
