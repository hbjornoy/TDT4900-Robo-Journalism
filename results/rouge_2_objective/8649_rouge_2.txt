study from the massachusetts institute of technology claims men and women are happier in single sex offices because they are more comfortable without the other gender around , a new study claims .
researchers found a higher level of contentment for men if they did not have to ` walk on eggshells ' around women , while women were happier when not dealing with a ` testosterone-fulled atmosphere .
more than half of women are bullied or harassed at work - often by members of their own sex , a major poll has revealed .
the study revealed that the biggest enemy facing women in the office or other workplace is often other women , rather than their male colleagues
