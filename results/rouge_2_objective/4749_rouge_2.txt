brendan rodgers needs to explain his team selection against real madrid to the fans , uefa president michel platini said on wednesday .
rodgers incurred the wrath of some reds supporters on social media sites when he left steven gerrard , raheem sterling , jordan henderson , mario balotelli and philippe coutinho out of the starting line-up , with an eye on the weekend 's premier league encounter with chelsea .
platini pointed out liverpool only lost 1-0 in spain last night compared to an apparently stronger line-up losing 3-0 at anfield .
