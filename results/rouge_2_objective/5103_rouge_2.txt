apple has filed a patent for a pair of headphones that automatically adjust the volume of music if they 're not inserted far enough into the ear .
the tech company has been criticised in the past for the headphones it sells with iphones and ipods because they ` leak ' music , meaning a listener 's tunes can be heard by people around them .
