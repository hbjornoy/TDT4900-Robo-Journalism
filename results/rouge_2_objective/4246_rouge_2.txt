immigrants are to be banned from taking driving tests in 19 foreign languages in a bid to stop cheating and boost road safety , it was announced tuesday .
plans to outlaw the test being carried out in ` non-national languages ' have been set out in a major consultation by the government 's driving standards agency .
nearly 145,000 tests are taken every year in languages other than english and welsh -- from albanian to urdu - at a rate of around 2,700 a week .
