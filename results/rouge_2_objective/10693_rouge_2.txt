marseille defensive midfielder mario lemina is reportedly a target for premier league side liverpool .
l'equipe claims that brendan rodger 's side has ` enquired ' about the 21-year old gabonese-born french player , although specific details over the potential transfer have been kept to a minimum .
lemina arrived at marseille for 4m euros in 2013 and has a contract with the ligue 1 club until 2018 , meaning the reds would have to pay a sizeable fee to complete a deal for the defensive midfielder who has made a single appearance for france 's under-21s .
