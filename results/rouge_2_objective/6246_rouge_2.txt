australian federal police have posted a humorous post on their official facebook page , updating the public on a drug bust by using cringeworthy fish puns .
afp have written about an arrest in sydney last week , in which two men were arrested for trying to import $ 75 million worth of drugs into sydney hidden underneath frozen fish .
the post uses terrible ` dad jokes ' to explain that , ` investigators knew that salmon was responsible .
the puns do n't stop there - the afp continues : the afp do n't mullet over ' in an effort to stop this sort of fin becoming commonplaice .
