former everton star tim cahill was on target as australia struggled to a tepid 1-1 draw in an international friendly against an under-strength south africa in sydney on monday .
more than 50,000 turned out at the olympic stadium to bid farewell to the socceroos before they depart for the finals but the home side struggled to break down a bafana bafana team weakened even from that which went out in the second round of african qualifying .
cahill and the australian team walk through a minute early in the first half with ayanda patosi 's 13th minute effort for south africa cancelled out by australia 's stand-in captain tim cahill almost immediatly .
cahill is congratulated by his team-mates
