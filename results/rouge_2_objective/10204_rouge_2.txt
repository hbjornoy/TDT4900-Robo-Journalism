in the two clips released on friday , the 13-year-old is seen lying in her bed at a new jersey hospital , moving on command .
in one clip , her mother , nailah winkfield , asks her to move her leg and the girl 's foot jerks in reaction .
her family have been fighting with the state of california ever since december , when the girl was declared brain-dead following a routine tonsil surgery at ucsf benioff children 's hospital in oakland , california .
mcmath 's family refused to accept the prognosis and eventually won an injunction preventing the hospital from switching off the ventilator , and transferred the teen to a undisclosed facility in new jersey
