jack the parrot loves popping down to his local pub for a pint of best and once got so drunk on rioja he fell off his perch .
he is at his happiest when he 's rocking out and squawking all over the world to his favourite band status quo .
mr mackinnon , 54 , an a&e nurse at hairmyres hospital , bought his pet for Ã¢ # 1,500 from a friend six years ago .
jack was only three months old at the time but his friend 's wife did n't like him .
