barbara nantais , 15 , was found strangled to death , mutilated with a knife and with a fistful of wet sand stuffed down her throat on a beach in san diego .
both murders languished in the cold-case file for more than 30 years until this month , when police used dna evidence to link two men to hough 's killing .
both suspects - convicted career criminal ronald clyde tatro and retired police criminalist kevin charles brown - have since passed away .
tatro was killed in an apparent boating accident in 2011 , and brown committed suicide last week by hanging himself in cuyamaca state park .
