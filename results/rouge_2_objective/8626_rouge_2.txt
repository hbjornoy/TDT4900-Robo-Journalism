managers at the new # 400 million university hospital of north staffordshire have applied for planning permission for five smoking shelters on site after patients repeatedly ignored the no-smoking policy .
they will be put up outside the hospital 's maternity block , two main entrances and its accident and emergency unit .
the final shelter is to erect a smoking shelter outside a cancer ward - a move which has infuriated victims of the disease and charities .
