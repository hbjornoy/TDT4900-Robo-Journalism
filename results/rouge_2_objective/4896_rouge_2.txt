peter schmeichel says manchester united 's failure to pick a settled back four will cost them in the long-run this season .
marcos rojo partnered chris smalling in the middle of the united defence for the 1-1 draw with chelsea on sunday and it was their eighth different pairing in nine games .
schmeichel played in the successful manchester united sides of the 1990s and with centre back pairings of steve bruce and gary pallister .
the former united no 1 was full of praise for goalkeeper david de gea but says he needs stability infront of him .
