pictures were broadcast last night showing bashar and asma assad receiving a rapturous welcome at al-fahya stadium in damascus .
they joined hundreds of volunteers boxing cartons full of flour , sugar , cooking oil and pasta for victims of fighting in homs , where the president 's forces are crushing an uprising .
the assads have long worked to manage their image , but it backfired a year ago when a glamorous photo shoot and gushing profile of asma , 36 , appeared in vogue magazine just as her husband launched a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests .
