philipp lahm will not be moved back to the national team for friday 's world cup quarter-final clash with france .
lahm was transformed into a midfielder by bayern munich coach pep guardiola last season and it is there where he has no plans to revert lahm back to his previous position of full-back , despite clamour in germany for changes to be made to the right-back position he had made his own for club and country over many years , earning recognition as one of the best in the world in that position .
lahm will hardly comfort many germany fans , who were left somewhat bemused by low 's choices during a tighter-than-expected game against algeria .
