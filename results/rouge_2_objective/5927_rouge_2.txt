sixty per cent of americans still favour capital punishment for convicted murderers , a poll has shown .
the survey demonstrates a clear majority for the ultimate punishment , although it is the lowest percentage since 1972 , according to a gallup poll released yesterday .
the current era of lower support may be tied to death penalty moratoriums in several states beginning around 2000 after several death-row inmates were later proven innocent of the crimes of the death penalty in november 1972 .
