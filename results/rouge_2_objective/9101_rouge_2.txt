cristiano ronaldo touched down in manchester on sunday evening ahead of his much-anticipated return to old trafford - a match that will see the real madrid star go head-to-head with ballon d'or rival lionel messi .
the former manchester united ace will make just his second appearance at his former stomping ground since leaving for madrid in 2009 - and the presence of barcelona 's messi means there will be a mouthwatering clash in prospect .
ronaldo will play for portugal against argentina at old trafford on tuesday .
