tropical forests are absorbing 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year as they photosynthesise the arctic .
the researchers claim their findings show that rainforests are essential for soaking up excess greenhouse gases , and play a far greater role than had been previously realised .
dr david schimel , a researcher at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in california , who led the study , said : ` this is good news , because uptake in boreal forests is already slowing , while tropical forests may continue to take up carbon for many years ' deforestation in the world 's biggest rainforest , the amazon , dropped by 18 per cent over the past year .
