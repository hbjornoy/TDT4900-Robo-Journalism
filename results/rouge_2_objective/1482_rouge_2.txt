residents are calling for the closure of a controversial landfill site , which overflowed leaving the streets infested with rats and trees filled with rubbish .
strong winds caused rubbish from the blaydon quarry , in tyne and wear , to be strewn across the neighbouring areas .
families living in nearby ryton , winlaton and greenside said their children were not able to play outdoors as the litter from the quarry was being swept up in the gales .
