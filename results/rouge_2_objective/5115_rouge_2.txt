tony blair looks more ` mr red ' than ex-government head as he channels his inner tarantino in manhattan yesterday .
the former british prime minister went for an afternoon stroll through new york city flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film reservoir dogs .
the casual observer could have been forgiven for assuming it was a bizarre re-enactment of the opening credits of quentin tarantino 's acclaimed 1992 crime caper - starring harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi .
he was in new york to receive an honour from humanitarian charity save the children at a star-studded ceremony in the city .
