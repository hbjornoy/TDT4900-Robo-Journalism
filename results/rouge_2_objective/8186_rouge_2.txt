the luton-based firm has announced it is to start offering some passengers the opportunity to buy an all-inclusive ticket by easyjet for the first time in its 18-year history in a move that could signal a change in direction for budget airliners .
the airline claims its new all-inclusive fare will be lower than if customers had chosen to book all the extras on top of their standard ticket .
the firm has charged customers less than many of its rivals for the seat itself , but then boosted profits with a raft of costs for extra services , such as inflight food and drink , which other carriers include for free .
