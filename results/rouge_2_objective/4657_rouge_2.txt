roslyn earle arranged cover for her five-bedroom wiltshire house through the century-old country gentlemen 's association .
the cga 's brokers placed her policy with european risk insurance , which lists an essex address but is actually based in reykjavik .
roslyn earle , 66 , submitted a claim after flood water warped solid oak floors , destroyed antique furniture and forced her to flee with only two cats and a suitcase .
mrs earle is now facing financial ruin after the company 's licence was withdrawn .
