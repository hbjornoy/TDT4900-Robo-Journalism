the u.s. navy skydiving team - aka the leap frogs - has done it for you ... and filmed the experience on a head-mounted camera .
the footage begins with the team looking out through the plane 's hatch over the californian city of san diego .
the team of three comprised jim woods , who wore the head-cam , vic maldonado and brad woodard , who both carried flags .
the jump was in honour of baseball legend jerry coleman , a new york yankees second-baser who was named the major league 's most valuable payer in 1950 .
