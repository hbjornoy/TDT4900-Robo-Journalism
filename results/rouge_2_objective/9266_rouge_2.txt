pair of stowaways , aged 29 and 31 , were caught this week after making the 20 mile journey from tangier to southern spain , just inches from the engine of a ferry .
omar iziel , 20 , had put on a wetsuit and managed to clamber into position before the ferry set off the port of tarifa , in the southern spanish province of cadiz .
police confirmed the moroccan man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed , pending being deported back to morocco .
