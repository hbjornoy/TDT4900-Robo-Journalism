floyd mayweather has promised to put on a boxing masterclass in las vegas on saturday night .
the pair originally fought back in may , when mayweather controversially won by split-decision to extend his unbeaten professional record to 46 bouts .
mayweather , 37 , only has a couple of fights left in his glittering career , but said there was no way he could not fight argentina 's maidana for a second time after an irrepressible demand from the public .
floyd mayweather jr and marcos maidana will go head-to-head in their welterweight fight on saturday .
