queens park rangers were left so concerned by new signing mauro zarate 's fitness that they contemplated pulling the plug on a loan deal with west ham united .
zarate has played just 14 minutes of the club 's two fixtures since arriving and was an unused substitute in saturday 's 2-0 home defeat by manchester united .
redknapp has been told he can only make loan signings this month due to the restrictions the club have already committed a substantial percentage of their wage budget this month .
