scientists announced today that measurements made by the european space probe philae , which landed on comet 67p in november , show the comet 's core is n't magnetised .
some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation .
the team led by hans-ulrich auster at the technical university of braunschweig , germany , said their data -- which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed philae to collect more results than planned -- do n't support this theory .
