adam lallana is ready to play through the pain barrier to help revive liverpool ' s season at old trafford .
the england international did n't figure in tuesday 's 1-1 draw with basle after he broke two ribs during the 3-1 win at leicester seven days earlier .
lallana had played against sunderland last saturday with the aid of a pain-killing injection and will do the same against manchester united .
