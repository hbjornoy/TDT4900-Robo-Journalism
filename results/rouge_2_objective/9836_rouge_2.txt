families in torquay , devon , visited what they thought was a golden stretch of shoreline to relax in the glorious sunshine - they were furious to find preston beach covered in seaweed .
some people did give up the council for failing to clear the seaweed which regularly coats the beach .
local resident carol greechan , who headed to the popular sunspot on monday with her two grandchildren , said : ` i 'm been going there for 30 years and i 've never seen it so bad ' torbay council said the occurrence is a natural phenomenon , cleans the beach on a rota three times a week .
