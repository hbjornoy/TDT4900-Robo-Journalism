commons speaker john bercow mistakenly introduced former england rugby star ben cohen at an event as ` openly gay ' last night .
the mp was introducing the ex-england rugby international to a room full of guests at parliout , parliament 's gay staff network , when he made the slip-up .
mr bercow was left squirming while the audience burst into laughter and mr cohen called out : ` do n't tell my wife !
' since retiring from professional rugby in 2011 , mr cohen , 34 , has dedicated much of his time to tackling the problem of homophobic bullying among young people through his standup foundation .
