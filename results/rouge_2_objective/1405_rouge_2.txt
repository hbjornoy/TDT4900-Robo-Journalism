northrop grumman 's mq-8c fire scout is missing one key thing - a pilot .
the firm this week showed off the craft taking to sea for the first time - and landing with pinpoint accuracy on a destroyer .
the drone does not need a runway to take off so the navy hopes to use it on smaller ships .
the craft has been stuffed with electronics so it can carry about 1,000 lbs , and can stay in the air for upto 12 hours .
