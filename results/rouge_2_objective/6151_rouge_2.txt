neither james adair nor ben stenning had rowed a boat before they drunkenly agreed to row the indian ocean .
after spending their # 15,000 life savings on an ocean rowing boat and undertaking just three months of training on the river thames , the pair not only succeeded in crossing the ocean , but also in becoming the first ever pair in history to row it without a support boat .
their heroics and pictures have now been revealed for the first time in the book rowing after the white whale , written by james adair .
