passengers on board the germanwings flight to hamburg said the pilot became so frustrated at the long wait and the lack of response from airport staff that he dialled 999 .
the plane was waiting to be ` de-iced ' , but many complained there only seemed to be one vehicle equipped to remove snow from all the planes and some claimed it broke down at one point .
a number of flights to destinations including belfast , paris and hamburg were unable to take off at the airport after a snow storm and plummeting temperatures meant conditions were not safe .
