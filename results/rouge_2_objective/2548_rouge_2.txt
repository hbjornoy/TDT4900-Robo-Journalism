the wrecked fuselage of the airasia jet at the bottom of the java sea is believed to contain most of the bodies of the passengers .
one more body was recovered from the sea 's surface today - bringing the total found to 51 - but experts believe scores of others are still strapped to their seats inside the wreckage .
it comes one week after investigators searching for black boxes in the crashed airasia plane lifted the tail portion out of java sea on saturday , two weeks after it went down , killing all 162 people on board .
