the haunted chicago mini-mansion , once owned by the inventor of barbed wire , has gone on sale for the frighteningly low price of $ 159,000 .
the home , built in 1882 , which purportedly witnesses the spirits of children haunting its empty rooms has something of a dark history too .
in 2004 , a 19-year-old man named steven jenkins was fatally shot during a party in the home and in 2007 , a john wilkes booth impersonator named seth magosky suddenly dropped dead at the age of 39 only six months after buying the fated property .
