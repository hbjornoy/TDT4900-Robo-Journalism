now it has apparently been deliberately vandalized and is missing a shadow of its former glory .
the tree that adorned the band 's album , joshua tree , is now a tourist attraction for thousands of u2 fans since 1987 .
the fan wrote on a u2 message board : ` i 've been visiting u2 's joshua tree in the california desert for nearly 20 years now the mojave is my home .
