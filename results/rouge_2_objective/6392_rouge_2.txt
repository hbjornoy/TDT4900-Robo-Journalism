andy murray seemed perfectly at ease on wednesday as he peacefully practised at wimbledon with his new team headed by amelie mauresmo -- seemingly immune to the pressures of a 200 metre race at a nearby running track between his fitness coach jez green and roger rasheed , coach of grigor dimitrov .
he did so having been boosted by confirmation that wimbledon 's unique seeding formula had bumped him up from his ranking of fifth to third position in friday 's draw , providing some kind of insulation .
andy murray beat novak djokovic to win his first wimbledon title last year .
