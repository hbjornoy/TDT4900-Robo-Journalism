the boyfriend and personal chef of the late wall street investor christopher browne are locked in a vicious legal battle over the legendary moneyman 's $ 300 million estate .
the broker 's jealous partner andrew gordon had swindled him out of almost $ 4 million that was left to him by browne in his will .
the suit alleges that gordon , who is 14-years browne 's junior , took advantage of his boyfriend 's failing health to push his favourite chef ouellette out of a job , out of his home and leave him with nothing after the investor died of a heart attack aged 62 , in 2009 .
