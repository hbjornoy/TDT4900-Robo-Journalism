amy and jerry pajotte love the new england patriots just as much as they do each other .
the couple , who moved to a house right next to gillette stadium four years ago , got married in custom-made patriots gear , included football references in their vows and made their grand entrance at the reception to the team 's song .
all of this garnered them attention from team owner robert kraft , who gave the newlyweds front-row tickets and a field pass to the patriots ' game against the chicago bears as a wedding gift , which amy attended in her gown .
