joseph corlett , 57 , is fuming after oakland university in rochester , michigan , kicked him off the school friday for $ 2.2 million and four lost credits , claiming his free-speech rights were violated .
corlett compared his female instructor to ginger , a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s tv show ` gilligan 's island .
the teacher informed an oakland dean after reading the journal for the first time .
corlett 's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and last year barred him for three terms , through winter 2013 .
the university said he must undergo counseling if he wants to return as a student .
