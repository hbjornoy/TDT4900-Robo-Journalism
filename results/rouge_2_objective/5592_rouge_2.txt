a chinese scientist claims an ancient fish has the world 's first face and it challenges current thinking on the history of human evolution .
the ancient creature was about eight inches long and swam in the prehistoric seas 419 million years ago .
it belonged to a group of early fish known as placoderms that had bony armour , or plates , on their heads and necks .
the superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish - offering a new perspective on early evolution .
