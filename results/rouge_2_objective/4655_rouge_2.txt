the user , known as dan , posted a scathing , one-star assessment of wonderful in millbrae near san francisco , california , claiming staff refused to seat him as he was alone , and even said they turned him down because of what he was wearing .
owners of the venue saw the disgruntled customer did n't speak to a single member of staff and quickly left after looking over video captured at the restaurant 's front door .
the review was taken down by yelp following a request by the restaurant , but has since been re-published by san francisco eater .
