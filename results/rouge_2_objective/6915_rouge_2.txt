dr robert ferrante , 66 , was sentenced to life in prison after allegheny county jurors in allegheny county , pennsylvania , convicted him last autumn .
prosecutors said he laced dr autumn klein 's energy drink with cyanide in april 2013 .
prosecutors failed to show that klein , 41 , had lethal amounts of cyanide in her blood , citing disagreement among expert witnesses as to whether she died of the poison or a sudden heart dysrhythmia .
mr eyster also argued that prosecutors presented ` not one shred of evidence ' that ferrante administered poison to his wife .
