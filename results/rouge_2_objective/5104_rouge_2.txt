animal rights activists smuggled secret cameras into farms and markets near beijing , where they spent three weeks pretending to be potential business partners from europe .
there they filmed the industrial scale of fur farming , a practice banned in britain 14 years ago but largely unrestricted in many countries including china .
the activists claim the animals they saw on the two farms , each holding 300 or 400 raccoon dogs , were confined to faeces-filled cages barely larger than their bodies .
