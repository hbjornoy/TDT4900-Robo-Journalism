james bond was far from the suave , english gent portrayed in the 007 films .
william boyd , the novelist famed for ` any human heart ' , and responsible for coming up with the next bond novel in the ian fleming series , said that bond 's true character , until now , had been underplayed .
he told the radio times that in the dr. no film , starring sean connery , bond downed two bottles of bourbon , a bottle of champagne , a calvados and four dry martinis in one night .
