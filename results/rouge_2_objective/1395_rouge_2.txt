two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for spanish slugs - an horrific , aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory .
the species , nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives , was first spotted in the uk in 2012 .
sightings have since been reported in norfolk , suffolk , essex , london and hampshire .
