new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from world war two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage underground station .
club owners charlie gilkes and duncan stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s , complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators .
the pair are owners of the bunga bunga bar and maggie 's nightclub , which is inspired by margaret thatcher .
