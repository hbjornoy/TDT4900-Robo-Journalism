arsenal chiefs have flown to spain in hope of striking a deal for real madrid forward alvaro morata .
the striker is a long term target of arsene wenger and the club have made an early move for the 21-year-old , who is also wanted by juventus .
morata scored nine goals in 28 games for real this season .
arsenal are willing to sell , but will insist on a buy-back clause which is likely to prove a key stumbling block towards a deal .
