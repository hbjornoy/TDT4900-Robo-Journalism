dash-cam footage has surfaced of the moment a lightning bolt strikes a tree , spliting it in half and sending it plummeting on to a busy road just centimetres from the bonnet of a car .
the dash-cam footage from ryde in sydney 's north , shows panicking passengers gasp as a burst of sparks shoot off the tree and a thundering boom in the air .
the video is from this week 's storms which battered sydney for seven consecutive afternoons , bringing grey but dramatic skies , spectacular lighting and the ear-splitting thunder .
