pakistani security forces also killed seven ` terrorists ' on the outskirts of peshawar - where the atrocity unfolded on tuesday morning .
the us drone strike took place in the town of datta khel in north waziristan , where pakistani troops have been carrying out a major operation against local and foreign militants since the appalling attack - in which 148 people , mostly children , were murdered - pakistani air strikes and ground operations have killed around 200 militants in the northwest tribal region near the afghan border .
the weapon has eliminated several top militants - but has also resulted in civilian casualties , making it extremely unpopular among pakistanis .
