hassan abdi dhuhulow , a 23-year-old somalian whom kenyan authorities believe was one of the terrorists in the westgate mall seige , was ` well-known ' to the pst domestic intelligence service , its chief said yesterday .
pst agents tried several times to persuade him to abandon plans to move to somalia in 2010 - and join jihadist group al-shabaab - but failed to stop the remains of four of the gunmen , who were filmed coldly gunning down fleeing shoppers in the upscale mall .
pst 's sister confirmed last week that her brother went to the somali capital of mogadishu for a three-month visit in 2009 .
