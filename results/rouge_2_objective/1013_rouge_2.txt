justin bieber was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing bieber singing his hit song one less lonely girl , but changing the final words to ` lonely n ***** ' the singer , who fans branded ` an arrogant little twerp ' over the footage , also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the ku klux klan .
the footage will further jeopardise his career , which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in america and his native canada .
