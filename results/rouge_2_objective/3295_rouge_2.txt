new zealand couple have been rescued from their locked car ` close to death ' 13 hours mollieanne and brian smith sounded the mazda 3 car horn and tried to smash the windows with a car jack as they sat trapped in the vehicle that was parked in the garage of their home in alexandra , on the south island .
the elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them .
