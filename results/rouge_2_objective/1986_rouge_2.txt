the first hawaiian house was consumed this week by the months-long , slow-moving lava flow that has been inching its way towards homes in pahoa , which has around 1,000 residents .
lava is also oozing out near a cemetery and at another spot about 400 yards upslope of a rural road , but hawaii county civil defense said in a statement thursday that the three breakouts do not pose an immediate threat to area residents .
kilauea has been erupting continuously for more than 31 years .
