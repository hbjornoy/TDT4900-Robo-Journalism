joe biden made another gaffe on the campaign trail on wednesday by mistaking what century it was less than 24 hours after his ` put y' all back in chains ' biden seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s when he told a virginia crowd : ` folks , where 's it written we can not lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles ?

williams was former alaska gov sarah palin , who went so far as to propose that biden should be replaced with hillary clinton if obama wants to be re-elected
