bernie ecclestone is accused today of avoiding a potential # 1billion-plus tax bill after the uk tax authorities scrapped an inquiry in return for just # 10million .
the secret deal could now be overturned -- and formula one supremo mr ecclestone , 83 , could again face a colossal tax bill -- thanks to associated claims that his ex-wife slavica mysteriously pays him # 60million a year .
the case focuses a fresh spotlight on complaints that the taxman is all too ready to agree ` sweetheart deals ' with the super-rich and big businesses .
