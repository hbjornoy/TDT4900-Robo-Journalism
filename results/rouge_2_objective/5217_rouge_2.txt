brian north , mbe , 72 , who was living in colorado , had assembled the two-thirds size se5a aircraft himself after having the parts shipped out from england .
he had completed the plane in october and had been flying it for about a month before the crash around a mile from front range airport near denver .
he then made a series of right turns until he was approaching the control but suddenly called the control tower again and got clearance to perform a ` touch-and-go ' landing .
