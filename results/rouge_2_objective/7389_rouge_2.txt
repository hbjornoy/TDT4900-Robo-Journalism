sir bruce forsyth is finally beginning to feel the weight of his 84 years .
the entertainer will take a holiday mid-series to recuperate from the strain of hosting the saturday night shows .
he seemed to struggle once or twice with the timing of his jokes on this weekend 's programme , but still happily warmed up the 500-strong audience beforehand with a combination of gags and song routines .
he will miss one show in a poor performance that saw her booted out of the competition in last night 's result show .
