defence secretary philip hammond is facing a revolt among his own mps over controversial plans to replace full-time troops with army reservists .
rebel conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with mps from labour and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the uk 's reserve forces .
the move , led by basildon tory mp john baron , could potentially threaten a coalition scheme to remove 20,000 full-time personnel and beef up what used to be called the territorial army .
the rebels , who also include former shadow home secretary david davis , will seek the backing of labour mps and those from smaller parties in an attempt to inflict a humiliating commons defeat
