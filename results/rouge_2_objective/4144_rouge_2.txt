francis ` frank ' archibald , 57 , is likely the next spy chosen to head the central intelligence agency 's national clandestine service .
the name of the man chosen as top cia spy was leaked on twitter wednesday , though he remains undercover as the agency chief in latin america .
the leak was likely related to a report tuesday that helped remove serbian president slobodan milosevic from power .
