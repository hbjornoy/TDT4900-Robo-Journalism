house of lords voted last night on an extension of the human rights act , which could cover middle-class elderly people who live in private care homes or pay to be protected under the same human rights laws as those who paid for their own care would be covered by the act .
under the current system , people whose care is funded by the state may sue care homes on human rights grounds if they are treated badly .
