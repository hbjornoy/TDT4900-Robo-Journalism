gareth bale has been left out of real madrid 's squad for wednesday 's champions league clash against liverpool as the wales international battles a muscle injury .
bale was unlikely to feature at anfield after madrid announced on monday that the forward was suffering from a gluteal -lrb- buttock -rrb- injury , and on tuesday the world 's most expensive player was a confirmed absentee from carlo ancelotti 's 20-man squad for the trip to anfield .
bale is also a doubt for real 's clash with barcelona on saturday .
