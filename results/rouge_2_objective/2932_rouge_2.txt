owners of william welsummer , or willy , have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise , after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early .
the noisy cockerel lives on the farm belonging to philip and caroline sutcliffe in eyam along with the rest of the couple 's birds .
they say other neighbours have never raised any problems with the bird .
