marcus luttrell , the ` lone survivor ' , has compiled a list of challenges the young man will have to overcome before taking addie on a date .
woe betide the first boy to ask out the two-year-old daughter of retired navy seal marcus luttrell .
the 200-word lecture , posted on facebook , reads : ` i 'm gon na make him contact every father of a daughter on here , mma fighter , police officer , fire fighter and let 's not forget the toughest of all prison guards to get their blessing .
the post was inspired by this year 's movie 22 jump street , in which ice cube plays a raging protective father .
