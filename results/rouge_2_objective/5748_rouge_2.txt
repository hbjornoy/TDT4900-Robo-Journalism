judges at the european court of justice said homosexuals facing imprisonment may have sufficient grounds to be allowed to stay in the eu .
the existence of laws imprisoning homosexuals ` may constitute an act of persecution per se ' a homosexual can not be expected to conceal his sexual orientation in his home country to avoid persecution , since it would amount to renouncing a ` characteristic fundamental to a person 's identity , ' the court added .
international treaties say people must prove they have a ` well-founded fear ' of persecution for reasons of race , religion , ethnicity or political opinion if they are to obtain asylum .
