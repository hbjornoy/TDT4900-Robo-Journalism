everton goalkeeper tim howard has advised manchester united counterpart david de gea to look upon the defensive upheaval at manchester united .
de gea , regarded as one of the best shot-stoppers in the world , has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury , suspension and differing formations .
howard , 35 , spent three seasons at united as a young goalkeeper and believes 23-year-old de gea needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back-four .
everton stopper tim howard argued de gea can improve as a goalkeeper as a result of this season
