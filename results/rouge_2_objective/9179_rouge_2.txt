st john 's college student lucan battison was suspended from a new zealand catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today .
mr bates said lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the catholic college three years ago .
the teenager 's lawyer jol battison was subsequently suspended by principal paul melloy last month .
the suspension was cleared on the basis that the 16-year-old returned with shorter hair .
