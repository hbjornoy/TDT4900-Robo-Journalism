germany 's mesut ozil is unlikely to play in the friendly against scotland on sunday .
arsenal midfielder ozil did not join team-mates on monday in duesseldorf for the first time since their world cup victory 50 days ago and will fly in on tuesday after nursing a minor injury .
ozil is one of 18 world cup winners called up in the 21-man squad for the world cup final rematch against the south americans and sunday 's first euro qualifier in dortmund .
germany coach joachim low will have to make changes to his starting lineup with striker miroslav klose , captain philipp lahm and central defender per mertesacker having retired from international football .
