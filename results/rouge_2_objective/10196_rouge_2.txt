house of commons authorities announced that mps would sit for just 145 days in 2014 , although a few more friday sittings will be added once decisions have been made .
the change has occurred because the lib dems , who would normally hold their party conference in the third week of september , had to move their gathering so as not to clash with the vote .
the total will be held in october next year , necessitating a week off at westminster .
