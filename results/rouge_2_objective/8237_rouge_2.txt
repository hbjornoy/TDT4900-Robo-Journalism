eintracht frankfurt forward alexander meier will have surgery on his patellar tendon on tuesday .
the bundesliga 's leading goalscorer is out for the season with a knee injury .
the club says meier tops the bundesliga with 19 goals , ahead of the bayern munich duo of arjen robben -lrb- 17 -rrb- and robert lewandowski -lrb- 16 -rrb- .
bayern 's robert lewandowski could be in a great position to win the bundesliga golden boot once again .
