officials for russia 's biggest airline aeroflot wasted no time in firing ekaterina solovyeva after she tweeted ` hahaha ' after a sukhoi superjet 100 went down south of the indonesian capital of jakarta on wednesday .
the stewardess wrote on her twitter page : ` huh ?
did a superjet crash ?
hahaha !
this aircraft sucks , it 's a pity it was n't in aeroflot , that would be one less ' about 45 people , reportedly including one american , were aboard the jet when it vanished from radar screens during what was meant to be a brief demonstration flight .
