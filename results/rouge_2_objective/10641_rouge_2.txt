mudstones from gale crater , the landing site of the curiosity rover , were formed in a lake that may have existed on the planet for hundreds of years , say scientists .
the 150 kilometre-wide -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- impact basin , with a mountain at its centre , is believed to have supported the lake - and possibly more than one - around 3.6 billion years ago .

the analysis showed that the lake was calm and likely had fresh water , containing key biological elements including carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur .
