jk rowling 's new detective novel is at the centre of a row between her new york publisher and online retailer amazon over the price of e-books .
the ongoing standoff has seen amazon remove pre-order buttons for a number of titles published by hachette , including ` the silkworm ' , which rowling has written under the pen name robert galbraith .
previous changes had been more subtle , such as the listing for the paperback version of j.d. salinger 's nine stories being changed to say delivery will now take three to five weeks , accompanied with notes offering similar items by rival publishers at a lower price and faster delivery time .
