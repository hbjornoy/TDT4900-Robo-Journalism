brian smith had to be cut out of the vehicle but ended up with relatively minor injuries , while his seven-year-old son , also called brian , was completely unhurt .
the 45-year-old is now recovering at his home in cumbernauld , in central scotland , and says he is lucky to be alive following the accident last friday .
he was driving his son to a swimming class in the town when the pipe fell onto his vauxhall corsa , crushing the roof completely .
