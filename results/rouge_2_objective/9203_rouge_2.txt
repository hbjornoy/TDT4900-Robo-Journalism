attorney-turned-cook and activist joan cheever has spent the past decade feeding the homeless from the back of her charity food truck , until earlier this month she was slapped with a $ 2,000 fine for her charitable efforts .
cheever founded the chow train non-profit organization in 2005 , preparing hot meals in her licensed mobile kitchen and serving them at city parks out of her personal pickup , which she has been using as a delivery truck because it is more compact .
cheever and her band of volunteers were dishing out free food to those in need at maverick park on the outskirts of san antonio when she was approached by four police officers on bicycles .
