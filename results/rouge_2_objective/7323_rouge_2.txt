fans of cairo 's al-ahly club have stormed egypt 's soccer federation headquarters and set it on fire after a court acquitted seven of nine police officials on trial for their alleged role in the port said stadium riot trial was announced .
earlier on saturday , a cairo court confirmed the death sentences given to 21 football fans for their parts in the riot , which claimed 74 lives and left 1,000 people injured .
fire also swept through a nearby police club , but it was not immediately clear whether al-ahly fans were responsible for that blaze as well .
