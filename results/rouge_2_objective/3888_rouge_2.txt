the safe is currently located in basel , switzerland , but the sellers say it can be removed and replaced anywhere in the world .
the vault is being sold by the generation basic income initiative , who campaign for a basic income for each swiss citizen on a monthly basis .
in october they placed eight million five-centime pieces into the bank vault , one for each citizen in switzerland before dumping the 15 tons of money in front of the parliament building in bern .
