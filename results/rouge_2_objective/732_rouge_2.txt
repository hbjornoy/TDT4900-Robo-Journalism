the trio had been travelling along the a45 fletchamstead highway in coventry in the west midlands when the bonnet and front two wheels were ripped from their green subaru impreza .
the remaining back portion of the car then came to rest on woodland next to the road and the driver and his two young passengers managed to scramble out , virtually unharmed .
a man and two children managed to escape with minor scratches after the car they were travelling in split in two .
