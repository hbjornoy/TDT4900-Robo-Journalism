uefa could face serious questioning after a number of cska moscow fans appeared inside the arena khimki during their champions league clash against manchester city .
uefa had banned the sale of tickets and ordered the group e match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by cska fans .
at least 200 supporters managed to get in to the ground and sat in front of the press box .
