geoff inskip , chief executive of centro , called on the government to take the m6 toll road out of private hands to ease congestion around britain 's second largest city , after evidence emerged that traffic on the toll road has fallen since its peak of 55,000 vehicles a day in 2006 .
it was hoped the 27 mile stretch would be nationalised rather than expanding the original m6 to cope with the projected 25 per cent increase in traffic over the next 15 years , transport chief geoff inskip said .
the # 900m road was completed ten years ago .
