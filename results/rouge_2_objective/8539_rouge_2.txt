two f-16 fighter jets escorted a small airplane out of restricted airspace in washington , an apparently inadvertent intrusion that prompted evacuations at the u.s. capitol and surrounding buildings .
the plane - a mooney m20c personal aircraft - entered the restricted airspace about 1:30 p.m. and was ` out of communications with air traffic controllers , ' the north american aerospace defense command said in a statement .
naadc spokesman master sgt. chuck marsh says military jets escorted the plane to an airport in mount airy , north carolina , where it landed saturday afternoon .
