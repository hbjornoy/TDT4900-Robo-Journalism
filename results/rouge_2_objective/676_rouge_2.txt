dorset speed group has compiled a database of the mobile speed cameras parked in seemingly dangerous locations including roadside verges , hard shoulders and slip lanes .
an action group believes that rather than making roads safer , the police road safety vans are increasing the risk to motorists on british roads .
the dorset speed has been calling for a ban on speed cameras since the death in 2011 of motorcyclist timothy rowsell , 64 , who crashed his bike and died after braking too hard when he saw a camera van near bournemouth .
