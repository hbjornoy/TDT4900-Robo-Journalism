fa chairman greg dyke is open to the idea of a foreigner succeeding roy hodgson - as long as the manager in question has a deep understanding of the english game .
dyke says the fa board has not considered whether they should extend hodgson 's deal beyond that tournament and the england manager claims he has given it little thought himself .
dyke confirmed earlier this summer that hodgson would remain three lions boss until his contract expires at the end of euro 2016 .
