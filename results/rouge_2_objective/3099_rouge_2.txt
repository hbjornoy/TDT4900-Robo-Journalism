hard rocker rob zombie , 48 , has been forced to issue a statement saying he is not anti-children after complaining about a ` noisy ' skate park near his connecticut home .
in a move widely condemned as ` hypocritical ' , zombie 's wife sheri told an annual town meeting the pair considered the hollow park skatepark - used mainly by young boys - to be ' a significant noise pollutant .
zombie is a heavy metal performer known for high-decibel songs including ` scum of the earth ' and ` living dead girl ' at last month 's litchfield county town .
