the ibaloi people , an ancient race from the philippines , smoked their dead dry for months to mummify them - giving them their firey nickname .
the preserved remains lie in dark caverns 4,000 ft up the side of mount timbac , near kabayan in the province of benguet , 200 miles north of capital manila .
some of the corpses have been locked away for more than 1,000 years .
