pope francis has opened a barber shop for homeless people in st peter 's square .
the state-of-the-art facility offers free haircuts , shaves and showers to rome 's down-and-outs .
the salon service , paid for by donations and the sale of papal blessings , was the idea of the pope 's chief alms-giver , monsignor konrad krajewski .
he was moved to act after a homeless man turned down an invitation to dinner at the vatican because he was embarrassed about his smell .
