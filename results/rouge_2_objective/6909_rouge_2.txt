marouane fellaini will face no action from the football association after he was cleared of intentionally spitting at sergio aguero in sunday 's manchester derby .
united midfielder fellaini and striker aguero clashed in the first half of city 's 1-0 victory at the etihad stadium last weekend .
the belgian can clearly be seen directing phlegm at aguero 's head as he launched a tirade at the argentine .
fellaini kicked his standing leg and the hosts appealed for a penalty , which was not given .
manchester city manager manuel pellegrini said he was not aware of the alleged spitting incident after the game .
