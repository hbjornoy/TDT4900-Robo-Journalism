nicole forni , a professional model from cleveland , claims she only agreed to pose for the provocative pictures on the condition that they were not sold on for any ` adult-oriented ' but after the shoot she and her family found the images used on websites for sex guides in germany and spain , an escort website in switzerland , as well as gracing the cover an erotic e-book entitled horny housewives of dubai .
the model is demanding $ 75,000 from joshua resnick , who took the photographs , alongside the slew of sex-related companies who allegedly used them .
