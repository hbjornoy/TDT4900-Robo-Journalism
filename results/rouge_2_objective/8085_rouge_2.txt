saracens are targeting a clean sweep of trophies this season after beginning their lv = cup campaign with a 25-20 win over harlequins at allianz park , according to assistant boss joe shaw .
the home side led 15-3 at the interval and appeared to be in complete control only for quins to improve greatly in the second half and run them close .
quins were totally out of sorts in the first half as elementary errors presented their opponents with two tries and saracens should have had the game firmly in the bag .
