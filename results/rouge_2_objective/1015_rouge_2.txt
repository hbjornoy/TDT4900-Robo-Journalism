turkish soldiers appear to have fired tear gas at citizens who were watching another day of bloody fighting in the besieged syrian border town of kobane .
scores of observers retreated from hillsides just a mile from the town - where the death toll in six weeks is said to have topped 800 - after military vehicles swept in earlier today in what turkey claimed was a bid to ensure their safety .
onlookers were seeing rubbing their eyes as canisters landed in between their vans and motorbikes on the rocky outcrop , which had afforded the best views of the fighting from a distance .
it is not the first time turkey has tear-gassed citizens watching the bloody conflict
