conservative mps have stepped up a row with britain 's leading aid charity over its ` misleading ' assault on the government 's austerity programme .
ministers are understood to share anger at oxfam 's campaign accusing the government of creating a ` perfect storm ' , which it suggested was fuelling hardship in britain .
oxfam insisted it had a ` duty ' to highlight hardship in the uk , but tories branded its attack a ` disgrace ' as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work .
