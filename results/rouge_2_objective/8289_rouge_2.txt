american airlines has rolled out a new pilot program designed to ease passenger congestion in the aisles - and collect more profits - as flights prepare for takeoff .
under the trial at just a few airports in the u.s. , you can get onto the plane and in your seat ahead of other passengers regardless of their row - as long as they travel without a carry-on bag .
travel expert john discala was the first to report the trial after he witnessed it firsthand at an adjacent gate .
the plane is then open to those who are asked to board first may lead to less passengers lined up for the overhead bins .
