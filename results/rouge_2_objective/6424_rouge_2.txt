brendan rodgers is hopeful recent signing lazar markovic will be available for their first premier league match of the season against southampton next week , as the serbian attacker nears full fitness following a tendon problem .
markovic , who moved to anfield from benfica for # 20million this summer , has not featured for the reds since playing one half of their friendly win against olympiacos in chicago on july 27 .
rodgers confirmed markovic is closing in on a return and said if the 20-year-old does not play some part at anfield on sunday , he will certainly be ready for liverpool 's match against manchester city on august 25 .
