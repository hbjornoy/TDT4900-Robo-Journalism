the 1,200-acre catskills resort was abandoned in 1986 - the year before the hit film , starring patrick swayze and jennifer grey as a dance instructor and baby houseman , a holidaying teenager at the fictional kellerman 's , was released .
the hotel and grounds were part of the borscht belt , an area of new york state that was popular with holidaying jewish families who faced discrimination elsewhere before cheap air travel meant trips abroad took off .
the likes of elizabeth taylor and jackie robinson stayed at the glamorous resort in its 1960s and 70s heyday .
