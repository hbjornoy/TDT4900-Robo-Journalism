didier drogba may miss the start of the season after twisting an ankle in sunday 's friendly against ferencvaros .
drogba hopes to resume training before the end of the week after scan yesterday showed no serious damage to ligaments but jose mourinho is not likely to risk the 36-year-old at burnley on monday if there is any doubt about his readiness .
the injury scare does , however , issue a reminder that mourinho 's squad is light on strikers , despite the # 32million signing of diego costa from atletico madrid .
