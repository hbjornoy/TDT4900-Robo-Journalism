one surfer was pictured flying off his board as he tried to take on waves near newquay , cornwall .
two other daredevils tried to harness the elements using their power kite , which lifted them off the ground above brighton beach in east sussex just feet from dangerous breaking waves .
one of the pair came perilously close to falling into the chilly english channel when a gust of wind blew him towards the water .
