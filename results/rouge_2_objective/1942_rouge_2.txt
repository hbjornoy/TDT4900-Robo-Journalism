the rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides , which sit in a separate block from the main table .
researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium .
lawrencium , which was first discovered in 1961 by the nuclear scientist ernest lawrence , is notoriously difficult to make and only exists for a few seconds at a time .
the results of new research suggest the element may have properties similar to sodium and potassium , which may fuel arguments that it would
