england team sponsor vauxhall were forced to apologise after breaching security by tweeting team sheets with the players ' passport numbers .
the official fifa team sheets always have the numbers alongside the names of the players , along with their date of birth , but the sensitive passport information is not for publication .
stan collymore tweeted a picture of the england team sheet - but it was tweeted hundreds of times before vauxhall deleted the tweet and issued an apology .
