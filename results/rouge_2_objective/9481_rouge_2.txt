devoted francis mulcahy , 50 , took his wife karine 's ashes two miles out to sea on a replica viking longship which he built himself .
he then set fire to the 3ft-long vessel and watched it sink - just like the traditional funeral services conducted by the vikings hundreds of years ago .
karine , of tavistock , died from a blood clot which spread to her lungs on september 15 last year and her funeral and cremation took place on september 23 .
