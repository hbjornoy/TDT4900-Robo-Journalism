george zimmerman will not face federal civil rights charges over the 2012 shooting of black teenager trayvon martin , it has been claimed .
zimmerman was last year acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 year old martin , following a high-profile trial in sanford , florida .
three law enforcement officials have reportedly said there is insufficient evidence to prove the killing was racially motivated and that the case will now have to be dropped .
