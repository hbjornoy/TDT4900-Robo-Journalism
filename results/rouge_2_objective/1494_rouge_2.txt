national poisons centre toxicologist dr leo schep thinks the culprit could be poisonous wine made from an innocuous-looking plant , according to a report in the new zealand herald .
some historians argued that alexander the great died from drinking wine that was tainted with a seemingly innocuous plant called hellebore .
veratrum album , known as white hellebore , is a plant that , once fermented properly , can be lethal .
dr schep , who has been researching the toxicological evidence for a decade , said some of the poisoning theories - including arsenic and strychnine - were not plausible .
