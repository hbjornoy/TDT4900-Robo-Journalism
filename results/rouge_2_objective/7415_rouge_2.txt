everybody wants a bite of the cherry ... but you 'll need deep pockets to do so -- as harrods has opened this year 's season for the fruit by selling them at the upmarket store in knightsbridge , west london , the mail on sunday paid # 41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g -lrb- 10.5 oz -rrb- and contained just 25 cherries .
the fruit is not available at all until april , when the only supply in the world comes from heated spanish greenhouses .
the harrods cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors .
