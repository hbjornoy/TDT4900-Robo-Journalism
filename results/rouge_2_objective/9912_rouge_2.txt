mountain bull , a 46-year-old african elephant , was found in mount kenya forest last week after his gps tracker installed by conservationists stalled .
he is thought to have been dead after poachers ripped his tusks from his skull .
the six-tonne elephant became the face of the save elephants campaign in october 2012 .
