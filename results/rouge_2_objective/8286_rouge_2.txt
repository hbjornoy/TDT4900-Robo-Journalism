california assembly is holding its first hearing on a bill that would have to end its killer whale shows and remove 10 orcas from their tanks .
the bill , number ab2140 , comes as a result of the cnn documentary ` blackfish ' which delved into the aggression of one of the male whales that led to a trainer 's death .
the 2013 film blames attacks and deaths of seaworld trainers on the mistreatment of the animals , increasing their aggression .
