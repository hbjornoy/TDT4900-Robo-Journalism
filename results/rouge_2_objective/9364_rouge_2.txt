in one image from previously unseen royal home movies the two young royals are seen dancing in their bathing towels across a beach in norfolk .
in another amusing scene the queen is seen waving on her two eldest children as they cycle in convoy with prince philip -- who 's mounted on a bike that 's way too small for him .
the footage was last night shown on the bbc programme a jubilee tribute to the queen by the prince of wales , giving a rare glimpse into some of her majesty 's most deeply personal moments .
