david edwards , who once played cello in the scottish national orchestra , gave up his professional music career to make doll 's house miniatures when he realised there was a gap in the market .
the miniaturist from edinburgh has made his hobby a full-time career , creating hand-crafted pieces including mini everyday household items such as pegs small enough to fit through the eye of a needle , mini shaving brush and kitchenware .
the violins , based on the world-renowned stradivarius , stand just one 12th of the normal size and can fetch a small fortune .
