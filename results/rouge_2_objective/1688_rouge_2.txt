dr toby phesse , of the walter and eliza hall institute of medical research in melbourne , said early data showed medication currently used to treat psoriasis , arthritis and myelofibrosis could help in the fight against the country 's second deadliest form of cancer .
he said the lab 's focus was directed at identifying which signalling pathways were used by tumours to grow and trying to target those pathways to prevent tumour growth in bowel cancer .
17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die .
