the fuhrerbunker , where nazi leader hitler spent his final months in berlin , is being planned for a summer opening at the ` top secret ' museum in the ruhr valley more than 300 miles from its original location .
the underground complex was destroyed in 1947 , after it was stormed in 1945 as the third reich fell .
the fuhrerbunker is being re-created by a german museum despite fears it may be deemed insensitive .
