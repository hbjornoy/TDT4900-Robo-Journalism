liverpool skipper steven gerrard will have no reason to complain about the state of the upton park pitch on saturday because of new rules saying the grass can not exceed 30 millimetres in height .
liverpool won 2-1 in the corresponding fixture last season gerrard , who scored two penalties , complained about west ham 's direct style , the distance the team bus had to park from the ground , the temperature of the changing rooms and the pitch .
gerrard won liverpool 's returning match in the champions league against ludogorets with a penalty .
