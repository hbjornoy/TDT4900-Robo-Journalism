retail giant amazon will be offering sunday delivery from november 17 in new york and la areas but will be rolled out to other cities including dallas and new orleans next year .
amazon says it is planning to extend the year-round service next year to all its customers after striking a deal with the us postal service -lrb- usps -rrb- .
the offer is thought to be the first of its kind in the us and provides a lifeline for struggling usps which lost $ 16billion last year , up from 3.3 billion in 2011 and 3.1 billion in 2010 .
