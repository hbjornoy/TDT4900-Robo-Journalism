vincent kompany and fernandinho could be back in manchester city 's line-up at burnley , with the club playing down reports they were dropped after a dressing-room spat .
the pair became embroiled in a heated argument at half-time during the champions ' 2-1 defeat at liverpool earlier this month .
city say the row had nothing to do with manuel pellegrini 's selection and the warring duo could be in the line-up for saturday 's match at turf moor .
kompany was dropped to the bench when manchester city hosted leicester city last week .
