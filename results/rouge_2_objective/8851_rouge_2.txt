she was diagnosed with the life-limiting condition cystic fibrosis when she was just five weeks old .
her mother sara dein , 36 , told mailonline : ` within 24 hours of olivia being born we knew something was wrong .
now olivia has written a letter to santa claus , outlining her wish for christmas this year - to be well , like her brother and sister ... dear santa , to a scooter or a bike , bright parcels adorn the bottom of christmas trees waiting to be ripped open on the big morning .
