talks have been ongoing since october with arsenal jumping back and forth to various targets but zagreb say they received an offer of # 6million on monday and are inching towards their valuation .
zagreb are in the process of finalising a permanent # 1m transfer for manchester united striker angelo henriquez , who has been on loan this season , and the cash from arsenal for brozovic will go towards that deal .
dinamo zagreb say midfielder marcelo brozovic is keen to use the money from arsenal to fund buying united 's henriquez .
