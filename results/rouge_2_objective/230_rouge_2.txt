peruvian government has been forced to act after 200 members of the mashco piro tribe staged several raids on a local village in peru stealing food and tools .
ministers said the attacks are a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on their food supply as loggers decimate their homeland .
the mashco are an indigenous tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers who inhabit the remote regions of the amazon rainforest .
