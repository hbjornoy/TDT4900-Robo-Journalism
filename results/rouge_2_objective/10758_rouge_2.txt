the whale drifted in from open waters in downtown seattle and has since been moved so biologists can figure out how it died .
the whale was towed from the dock to a nearby location thursday afternoon , said broch bender , a spokeswoman for the washington state ferries .
the plan is to move it to another secure location for an autopsy .
