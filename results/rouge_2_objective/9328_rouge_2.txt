new zealand herald reports that in july the council of dunedin city , on the south island 's east coast , will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns , trimming hedges , and cutting back foliage .
the gangs have been involved in drug trafficking , alleged murder , and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace , not war .
both the mongrel mob and black power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades .
