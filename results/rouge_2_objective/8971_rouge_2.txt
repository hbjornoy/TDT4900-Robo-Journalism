london ambulance service has 175 australians starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps .
the issue of staffing shortages for australian ambulances was highly publicised last year when there was a significant delay in paramedics reaching cricketer phil hughes , who later died from severe head injuries .
the industry needs more funding to create more jobs so australian paramedics are not seeing overseas as a more attractive option .
