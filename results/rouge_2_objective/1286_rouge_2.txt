the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets -- the launch costs alone would be more than $ 12 billion -lrb- # 7 billion -rrb- .
rocket-powered fusion , however , could one day allow 30 - and 90-day expeditions to mars by making the trip more practical and less costly , experts claim .
