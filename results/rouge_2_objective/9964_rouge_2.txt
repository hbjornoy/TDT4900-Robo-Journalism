julie bishop 's loyalty to prime minister tony abbott is under question after she released a weak statement where she appeared to be keeping her options open .
despite mr abbott telling reporters he and ms bishop would ` stand together to defeat the motion ' sky news is reporting she would not stand on a joint ticket with the prime minister .
ms bishop , who did not appear with mr abbott , would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support .
