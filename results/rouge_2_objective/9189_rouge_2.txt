robert maday , 42 , was convicted on wednesday thanks to a letter he wrote to his girlfriend boasting about his crime spree .
he was already a convicted bank robber when he wrestled two cook county state 's attorney investigators as they drove him to court in 2009 , getting away with their guns and one of the men 's pants .
he used the guns to commit separate hijackings against two women in chicago 's suburbs before robbing a bank , all while being hunted by police .
