u.s. district judge alvin hellerstein 's ruling on friday gives the government , which has fought the case for over a decade , two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released .
the american civil liberties union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable .
the fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and it invokes the images of abuse at the abu ghraib prison in iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 .
