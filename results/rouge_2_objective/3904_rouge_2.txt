james packer 's new crown casino was cleared to run a new high-rollers casino in just three months , which the body responsible for approving it believes could be the fastest time in history .
independent liquor and gaming authority chief executive micheil brodie said the speedy probity clearance was far below the average of the 12 months it normally takes , according to the sydney morning herald .
mr brodie , who oversaw the probity check , said the process was fast-tracked because the nsw government advised the gaming authority to take into account the findings of an earlier probity check into mr packer 's company .
