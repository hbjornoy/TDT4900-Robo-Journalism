the near-earth asteroid 2012 xe54 is about 120ft wide - big enough to cause substantial damage if it ever hits us .
the moon orbits at an average distance of xe54 streaking through the sky on tuesday , during a flyby that brought it inside the moon 's orbit .
an object of similar size flattened 800 square miles of forest in siberia in 1908 .
