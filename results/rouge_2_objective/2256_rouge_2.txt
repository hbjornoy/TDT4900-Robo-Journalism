alice powell , a 21-year-old racing driver from chipping norton , is in contention to drive alongside the likes of lewis hamilton at the abu dhabi grand prix after her grandfather said he would pay to turn her dream into reality .
powell , whose formula one aspirations are supported by the prime minister , would become only the sixth woman ever to take part in a formula one weekend .
the administrators have since launched a ` crowd-funding ' project whereby the public can contribute towards a target of # 2.35 million that would allow the team , who have missed the last two races , to compete at the championship decider in abu dhabi on sunday week .
