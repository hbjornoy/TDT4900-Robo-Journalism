research has revealed that there has been an increase of 66 per cent in bookings for the italian city , which hit the headlines this autumn when film star and director clooney married amal alamuddin at the seven-star aman canal grande hotel .
the rise in bookings could in part be attributed to venice 's dedicated christmas food market in the campo santo stefano , with stalls offering creamy-white almond stuffed nougat , fruit-filled panettone from verona and white truffles from alba .
