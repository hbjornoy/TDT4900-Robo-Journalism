yorkshire terrier emma got her paw wedged down a plug hole after a bath and it took rspca officers more than half-an-hour to get her free .
the rspca carried out 200,000 rescues last year many of which really took the biscuit - including a dog who got stuck in a wall for five days , and a deer trapped in a football net .
terrier emma was rescued in what may well be the most bizarre operation of the year .
