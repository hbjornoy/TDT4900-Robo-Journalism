president obama appears to shrug-off his well-publicized spat with hillary clinton - joining the former secretary of state on the dance floor to boogie the night away at a friend 's birthday party .
the president was photographed getting his groove on at the martha 's vineyard party on wednesday night following a dinner where he sat next to mrs clinton days after she criticized his foreign policy .
in an interview last weekend , clinton described u.s. policy in syria as a failure and said obama 's doctrine of '' ` do n't do stupid stuff '' is not an organising principle ' for a great nation .
