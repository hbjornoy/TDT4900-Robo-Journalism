soft drink company sodastream is closing the factory in the west bank that drew hollywood star scarlett johansson into the dispute about israel 's occupation of the palestinian territory .
the company said the decision to move the factory to a location inside israel was for ` purely commercial ' reasons and was not connected to pressure from pro-palestinian activists who had boycotted the company because of its location .
the decision upset oxfam international , a humanitarian aid organization for which johansson had served as a global ambassador for eight years .
