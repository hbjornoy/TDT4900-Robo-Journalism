17-year-old girl is pregnant and claims sarfraz riaz , one of the men who was given an order to stay away , is the father of her unborn child .
last month ten men were given injunctions by birmingham city council barring them from contacting the teenager or other under 18s they did not know after a judge ruled they had sexually exploited her .
the girl had described 32-year-old mr riaz as her ` boyfriend ' during proceedings at the high court in london and said he had fathered her child .
