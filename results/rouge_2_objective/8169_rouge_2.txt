the ultimate robin crusoe escape , a lonely house on its own island - just off the coast of cornwall .
the interiors are a luxurious mix of sleek neutrals and modern design , with panoramic sea views offered at every turn .
the house in the sea is connected by a 100ft suspension bridge , which stretches 90ft above the ground .
