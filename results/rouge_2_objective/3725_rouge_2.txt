wen li , a professor of psychology at the university of wisconsin-madison , used brain imaging to reveal how anxiety or stress can be an indicator of anxiety .
humans ' sense of smell is affected when we are anxious , with stress re-wiring the brain so that scents do n't smell right , according to a new study .
previously neutral smells become unpleasant and the greater the stress in smell , scientists claim .
the study found that this transformed neutral odours to distasteful ones , which could fuel a feedback loop heightening distress and leading to depression .
