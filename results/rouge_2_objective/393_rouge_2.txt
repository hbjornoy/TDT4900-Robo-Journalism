chelsea 's branislav ivanovic begins to go to ground under the attention of west ham 's andy carroll .
the former world cup and premier league referee graham poll believes the serbian threw himself to the ground .
ivanovic was attempting to win a penalty for chelsea that could have put his side 2-0 up in the first half .
ivanovic thought that carroll would grab him but got it wrong and really should have been cautioned for simulation by the otherwise excellent michael oliver .
