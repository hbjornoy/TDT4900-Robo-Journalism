customers of hsbc , barclays , natwest , natwest and nationwide will be paid compensations over the next few months .
the city watchdog found many debit and credit card customers were duped into buying these policies which offered unnecessary cover if you lost your credit card or were victim to identity fraud .
it follows an investigation last year by the financial conduct authority into cpp , a company which sold so-called card and identity theft cover via banks between 2005 and 2011 .
the compensation will leave the banks with an estimated # 1billion bill but there are fears that it could be higher .
