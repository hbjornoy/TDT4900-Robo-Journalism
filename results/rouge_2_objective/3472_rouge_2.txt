susan popland wants to get in contact with her childhood friend maureen bradley in the hope she still has the other half of a signed ticket to a beatles concert in 1962 .
she shared the prized ticket with a schoolmate , tearing it in two and giving up the piece signed by john lennon , george harrison and pete best , the band 's original drummer , while keeping the section autographed by her heart-throb paul mccartney .
she is on a mission to make contact with the concert-goer and reunite the tattered fragments .
