unlike italy , britain has dithered over deporting abu qatada -lrb- above -rrb- because of a judgement blocking the move by the european court of human rights .
the strasbourg court ordered that compensation be paid to mohamed mannai , who was sent home to tunisia in 2010 in breach of a court order , officials said they are unable to force italy to take him back .
mannai was jailed for five years and four months in october 2006 .
