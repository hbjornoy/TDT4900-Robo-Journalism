professor nick curzen said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients .
the tests , called angiograms , involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart .
professor curzen , a consultant cardiologist at southampton general hospital , said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted .
