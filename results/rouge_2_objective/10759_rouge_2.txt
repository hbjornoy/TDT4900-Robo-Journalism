josep pujiula , 77 , began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the fluvi√† river in catalonia in 1980 .
the maze , which recalls guillermo del toro 's 2006 spanish fantasy film pan 's labyrinth , has half a kilometre of walkways and is constructed from rustic materials like wooden planks and sticks bound with rope .
two giant wooden towers stand at the top of the hill ; a retired textile worker has spent the past 30 years building a sprawling enchanted maze in the forests of spain .
