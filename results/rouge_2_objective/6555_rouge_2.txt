underwater photographer regan mizuguchi was busy taking pictures of himself off the kohala coast in hawaii when the fish swam into shot and decided it wanted to be famous .
the frightened fish managed to completely eclipse the face of mr mizuguchi after inflating its body as a defence mechanism .
the sharp spines were a safe distance away from the hawaiian , and after realising he was n't a threat the fish deflated and swam away .
