a federal jury on friday decided a former hawaii soldier convicted of murder is eligible for the death penalty in the first capital case in the history of hawaii 's statehood .
jurors will next deliberate on whether naeem williams should be sentenced to death or life in prison with no possibility of release for killing his 5-year-old daughter .
the drawn-out case has gained attention in part because it involves a capital offense in a state that does n't have death penalty .
hawaii 's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957 , before hawaii became a u.s. state in 1959 .
