jericho the horse looked less than impressed by the unwanted passenger as he tried to enjoy a lazy afternoon in the sun at an animal sanctuary in plettenberg bay , south africa .
the cheeky primate played jockey on jericho 's back and even rolled around , seemingly using the horse to scratch an itch during the ride .
the baboon uses jericho 's rump to seemingly scratch a reasonable ride around the grounds of monkeyland and birds of eden , much to the amusement of onlookers .
monkeyland , which opened in april 1998 , bills itself as the world 's first free roaming multi-specie primate sanctuary and aims to rehabilitate and free previously caged primates .
