house hunters viewing this property had a shock when they stepped inside - as it 's been decorated entirely in purple .
everything from the wallpaper , carpet , upholstery and furniture is violet and even the kitchen and bathroom did n't escape the purple theme .
the white kitchen unit is on the market for # 400,000 - with a buyer already said to be lined up .
the only purple insight are few lilac flowers planted in pots by the door .
