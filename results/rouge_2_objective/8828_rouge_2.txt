parys , from bialystok , poland , will undergo surgery tomorrow in order to receive his new nose , which was designed by polish company ledo .
the tube shaped implant was invented by dr marcin elgal elgal from the individual medical implants technopark , after he accidentally caught it in a snare - but he could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who are planning to insert a specially designed implant into his snout .
the implant was specially designed for parys following a ct scan - the average dog has 125 to 220 million smell-sensitive receptors .
he will then be sent home to recover with his new owner , magdalena smosarska , in bialystok
