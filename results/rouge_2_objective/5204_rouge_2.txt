residents in a block of flats in colchester , essex , were told red tape means the binmen ca n't collect rubbish there when it 's too dark for them to see it .
the massive pile of 70 stinking black binbags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile .
the binmen have now refused to collect any more rubbish from the flats , saying they ca n't be seen to be breaking the rules .
many of the bags now spilling out of the store are split and rats have already been spotted in the area just yards from people 's front doors .
