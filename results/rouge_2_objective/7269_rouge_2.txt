leicester manager nigel pearson is eligible to represent england under-21s at the european championships next year .
the question has been raised about whether premier league clubs would let players such as raheem sterling , jack wilshere and ross barkley travel to the czech republic to boost the squad .
pearson , who was under-21 assistant manager during 2007 and has liam moore under his guidance at leicester , believes the fa could simply apply fifa rules obligating players to appear for their country .
