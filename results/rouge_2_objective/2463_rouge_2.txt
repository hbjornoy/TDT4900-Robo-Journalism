sixty beauty queens from across the country are vying for the title in a four day contest where they will have to participate in various rounds including the eco-fashion round - where contestants have to make their own green outfit - and the evening gown round .
the models were still given the opportunity to show off their figures today as they hit the beach and posed on a yacht in the english riviera to promote the competition .
the final will be held in torquay this year as it is the home of last year 's winner , charlotte holmes .
