the autumn fruiting is expected to be delayed as a result of the late spring , but the recent warm weather means wild berry crops will flourish , according to early data collected by the public for the woodland trust 's nature 's calendar project .
the promise of a bumper autumn is good news for wildlife , which suffered in the face of exceptionally poor crops of wild fruit last year when trees and shrubs were affected by the washout summer , and then were hit by this spring 's cold snap .
