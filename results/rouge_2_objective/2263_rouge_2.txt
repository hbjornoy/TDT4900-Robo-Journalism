nivin el gamal , 53 , married sheikh ahmed al maktoum , one of the middle east 's richest men with a # 19billion fortune , in an islamic ceremony in london four years ago .
she was unceremoniously dumped and sheikh ahmed denied they were ever in a relationship -- calling her an ` occasional sexual partner ' she denied there was ever any ceremony and that the woman who claimed to be his ` wife ' was no more than a ` courtesan ' who attached herself to rich men to buy her things .
