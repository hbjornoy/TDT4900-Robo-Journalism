sportscaster bob costas debuted a new look during a broadcast on thursday night that he has contracted an eye infection while in russia - and has been forced to don a pair of glasses at the sochi games - from unfinished hotels to undrinkable water - but for bob costas , it 's gotten far more personal .
costas ' eye was decidedly red , watery and swollen behind his specs .
the sportscaster revealed he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red ` as the soviet flag ' it will take a couple of days to heal .
