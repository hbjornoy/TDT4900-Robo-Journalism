controversial plans to shut nhs hospital wards could trigger a fresh wave of a&e closures .
billions of pounds will be diverted from hospital budgets to help pay for better care homes and home help under the proposals , which are set to be signed off by ministers within weeks .
frontline doctors also fear the massive shake-up will cause more a&e departments to close -- at least # 2billion a year from the health service budget .
the # 3.8 billion better care fund is meant to ensure that the sick and elderly only end up in hospital when they really need to be there and stop them staying in a ward for longer than necessary .
