the new pro version of microsoft 's surface will come out of the box with nearly two-thirds of its 64gb storage already used up by its operating system and pre-installed apps .
the $ 899 tablet computer will boot up with just 23gb of usable space , while its 128gb big brother will actually only have 83gb free .
the revelation is an embarrassment for microsoft , with the lack of free space damaging claims its latest top of the range tablet could be a fully featured laptop replacement .
