alastair cook could repeat his achievement in india in turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 test lead .
the extraordinary fourth test victory , england 's first within three days against india since 1967 , was a triumph for a captain on the end of fierce criticism after the low of lord 's and a coach in moores who had much to prove .
the bitter aftermath of the worst winter in england 's history increased the pressure on cook and moores but peter moores was not among them .
the england hierarchy have always been adamant that cook was going nowhere .
