israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said saturday that he has given the country 's security forces the permission to use ` all measures ' to find three teenagers who authorities say were kidnapped in a jewish settlement on the west bank .
the three teens have not been seen or heard from since thursday evening or friday morning , and an islamic extremist group called dawlat al-islam has reportedly taken credit for the abductions .
the prime minister says he has asked palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas ` to do everything to help bring them back in peace '
