instead of paying # 5 for a set of four passport snaps , people can now use the touch screen inside the converted booth to listen to up 300 pre-recorded prayers and incantations in 65 different languages .

it has opened at the university in manchester as part of a # 500,000 three year research project into prayer rooms and ` multi faith spaces ' across the world .
