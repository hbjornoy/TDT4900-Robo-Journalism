cristiano ronaldo has seen madrid 's top assist provider angel di maria leave for manchester united .
there was no transfer bombshell on deadline day at real madrid so cristiano ronaldo took it upon himself to send a few shockwaves through the club with a damning indictment of its transfer policy .
cristiano ronaldo claims he would do things differently if he would not have sold the team 's hugely experienced midfield fulcrum xabi alonso to a direct champions league rival in bayern munich before new man toni kroos was properly bedded-in .
di maria signed for united in a # 60million british record fee move .
