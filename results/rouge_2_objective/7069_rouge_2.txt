england basked in the match-winning batting of joe root and james taylor in pallekele , it was easy to forget that the platform for their run-chase had been laid the day before by chris woakes .
woakes finished with six for 19 in 2.5 overs at the end of the sri lankan innings on wednesday .
england 's one-day side still has its problems , of course , and defeat on saturday would add yet another series loss to the ledger .
