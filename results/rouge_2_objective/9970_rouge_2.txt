funeral director julian riley , 39 , emptied the 2lb bag of self-raising flour over peter elliot 's mercedes in a parking row outside his funeral parlour , only for it to set as hard as concrete and cause # 7,000 of damage .
he admitted throwing the flour , not expecting it to have caused any damage , but when mr elliot , 60 , took the car to a specialist garage they found it had dried on the paintwork like ` brittle cement ' riley was arrested and admitted damaging the mercedes-benz e-320 .
