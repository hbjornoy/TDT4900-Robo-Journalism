nikita bikov , 22 , was dozing against the door of the truck when it came open - throwing him into the path of oncoming traffic .
he narrowly avoided being hit by cars on the motorway near vladimir , in western russia , staggering to the side of the road just moments after the fall .
mr bikov was left winded and sore from the force of the fall on his way to work .
the truck was given a very rude awakening when he fell out of the vehicle and on the busy road .
