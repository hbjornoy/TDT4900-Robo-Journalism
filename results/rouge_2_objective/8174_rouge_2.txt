tottenham head coach mauricio pochettino was impressed by the way kyle walker performed on his comeback from a nine-month injury lay-off .
the 24-year-old had been laid low since march with a pelvic complaint which caused the right-back to miss the world cup and the start of the argentinian 's reign in north london .
walker suffered a setback in september and underwent lower abdominal surgery - a move the north london club had hoped to avoid - but on thursday he at last made his first-team return .
