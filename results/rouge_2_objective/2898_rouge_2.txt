crews watch as the harriet rees house was moved atop a huge array of automated dollies , crawling and inching at one-half-foot per second on 250 wheels .
weighing more than 1,000 tons , the three-story brick house is 95-feet long , 25-feet wide and 72-feet wide and one of the last residential remnants of the gilded age in the windy city .
the house was built for the widow of a real estate innovator , and stood near homes built by george pullman and marshall field .
