the scene at mcconnell air force base in kansas was captured on august 8 last year by airman 1st class armando a schwier-morales , but until this week it has been kept under wraps .
the woman is hit with pain and clutches the first thing she can get her hand on : his colleague in a training session as she prepared to be tasered , the us security squadron had no idea that he too would be struck with pain just seconds later .
the recruits are trained to use and understand tasers before they can carry one .
