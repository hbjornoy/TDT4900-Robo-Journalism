radamel falcao , hatem ben arfa , marcos rojo and danny welbeck all moved clubs .
the 28-year-old colombian scored 13 goals in 22 games at monaco last season .
falcao is the sixth-most-expensive striker in the game at # 10.3 m , yet he is well worth the investment because he will bring you point after point with robin van persie and wayne rooney for a starting place up front at old trafford , no club pays someone # 280,000-a-week and a # 6m loan fee if they do not intend to start them .
