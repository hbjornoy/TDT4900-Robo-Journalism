australian babies are baffled by the accent and find canadians easier to understand .
associate professor paola escudero , who led the research with the university 's dr karen mulak , says : ` we wanted to find out what accent they would be most comfortable when learning the words .
the babies in each group were shown an object , and heard the name for the object repeated over and over , spoken by a speaker of australian english or canadian english .
