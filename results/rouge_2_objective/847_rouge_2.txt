marin cilic hailed the impact of coach goran ivanisevic after winning his first grand slam title at the us open .
cilic became the first croatian to win a major title since ivanisevic 's famous triumph at wimbledon 2001 with a stunning 6-3 , 6-3 win over kei nishikori in new york on monday .
cilic was full of praise for the improvements ivanisevic has helped make to his game after the pair started working together in september 2013 .
cilic , 25 , will now move up to no 9 in the world rankings after claiming a title which seemed unthinkable prior to the tournament .
