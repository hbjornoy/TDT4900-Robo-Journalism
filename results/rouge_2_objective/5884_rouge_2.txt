president barack obama came out swinging on wednesday just 14 hours after a republican wave swept over the u.s. congress in an election that largely repudiated his policies .
he hinted at executive orders that he has used only twice in nearly six years .
he acknowledged that the gop won tuesday 's elections , but framed the results as a mandate for republicans to work with him , instead of the other way around .
obama insisted that he wo n't budge on immigration and other key issues despite republicans ' tussling with the president focused on executive orders related to immigration reform .
