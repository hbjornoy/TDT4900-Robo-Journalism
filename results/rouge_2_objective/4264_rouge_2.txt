rodney wilson and partner pat wenn moved onto the land in walsoken , norfolk in 2006 but ignored the local planning laws which outlines a ban to build on the site .
they found themselves in another battle with west norfolk borough council when it emerged their double park home - which has a front garden and an ornamental pond - was too big and did n't adhere to the planning proposal .
mr wilson , 70 , said the battle has already cost him # 30,000 in planning fees and it would cost him another # 38,000 to reduce the size of the property in which he and his partner were planning to retire in .
