2gb talkback radio host ben fordham caused a stir on thursday morning when he tweeted : ` interesting fact : malcolm turnbull and julie bishop have arranged to meet at his sydney home today ' mr turnbull and ms bishop have been at the centre of leadership speculation in recent days , with ms bishop issuing a picture of himself seated on a sydney train , grinning .
he then posted a series of images of his train crossing the hawkesbury river , featuring mangroves and settlements along the riverside .
the spat provoked ms bishop to live-tweet his train trip to the nsw central coast .
