two-year-old mr bernie -- one of 330 orphaned apes at the orangutan care centre and quarantine in borneo -- will do just about anything to avoid taking a plunge .

at the orphanage there are no ape mums to help out .
in the wild , orangutans usually shy away from water , preferring to keep themselves clean through picking out bugs and dirt with their long fingers .
