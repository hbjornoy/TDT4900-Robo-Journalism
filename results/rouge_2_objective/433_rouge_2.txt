wayne sperling , 66 , and lorinda bailey , 35 , were arrested and charged with four counts of felony child abuse after their sons were found living in a feces-ridden home littered with cat feces , flies and urine in denver last month .
the couple also had three other children taken away from them in 2006 when they were discovered living in similarly appalling conditions during a welfare check .
the children 's faces were black with dirt and they were seen playing in the road and officers found the apartment door open , with only an upstairs neighbor watching them with a sound monitor .
