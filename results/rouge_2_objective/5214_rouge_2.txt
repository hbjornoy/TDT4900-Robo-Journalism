the woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the earth , not by overhunting as previously believed to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun , causing temperatures to plummet , plants to die and landscapes to alter forever .
they believe a huge meteor smashing through the earth 's atmosphere broke up into ten million tonnes of fiery fragments , scattering over four continents .
the research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests that this caused the extinction , countering previous theories that the spread of human settlements and aggressive hunting was to blame .
