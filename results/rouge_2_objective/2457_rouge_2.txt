scientists from the un have warned that emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 Â°c above pre-industrial levels .
other greenhouse gases , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- , need to follow suit so that if the world carries on as it is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control .
the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- said that emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by 2030 .
