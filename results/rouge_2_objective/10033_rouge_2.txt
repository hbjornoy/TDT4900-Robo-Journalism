gareth bale will score 30-plus goals - providing he stays fit .
the confidence he has built up in the past 12 months at real madrid and the physical power he can now add to his talents will see him take his game to another level .
the players around will help of course , but it would n't surprise me if real madrid won both the champions league and la liga , with bale taking centre stage .
wayne rooney will have his best ever season at manchester united .
