camilo villegas produced a sparkling eight-under-par 63 to claim the first-round lead in the wyndham championship at sedgefield country club in greensboro , north carolina .
americans william mcgirt and webb simpson - the 2011 wyndham champion - must have thought they had done enough to head into day two of the final regular event of the pga tour season at least top of the pile , but colombian villegas had other ideas .
villegas was delighted with his start to the tournament .
