olympic gold medalist amy van dyken-rouen is getting back in the pool as part of her rehabilitation .
the six-time gold medalist , who severed her spine in an atv accident earlier this month , tweeted that she was excited to learn she would be swimming - and used the hashtag #freedom - before she shared an image of her wearing her goggles in her hospital bed .
the 41-year-old has shown almost superhuman strength as she endures a painstaking recovery and continues to show resolve as she embarks on months of rehab and using a wheelchair .
