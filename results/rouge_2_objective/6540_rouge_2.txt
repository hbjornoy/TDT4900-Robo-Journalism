cambridgeshire constabulary sent out the message from cambridgeshire police advised on how to trim their hedges .
the tweet , which has since been deleted , was branded ` utterly bizarre ' by followers .
twitter users were confused by the hedge-trimming directive from their @cambscops twitter feed saying : ` doing a bit of gardening this weekend ?
make sure your hedges are neatly trimmed , max 1m at the front and 2m at the back '
