guy padraic hamilton-smith , 30 , graduated in the top third of his law school class at the university of kentucky , but the state supreme court blocked him from taking the bar exam after he was entered on the sex offenders registry for possessing child pornography in 2007 .
he was convicted of a charge related to child pornography .
in the first case of its kind in kentucky , the court rejected hamilton-smith 's bid and a move by the state office of bar admissions to create and endorse a blanket rule that would have kept all registered sex offenders from gaining access to the bar .
