john cousins , who owns a 3d printing services company , was giving a talk on the medical uses of the technology at bournemouth hospital .
john cousins used his firm 's 3d printing software to make a model of his own kidney before having surgery to remove a stone from it .
mr cousins was rushed to the facility 's own a&e department for scans .
the model cut the operation time significantly and helped guide surgeons .
scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5 cm - and shaped like a stag 's head .
