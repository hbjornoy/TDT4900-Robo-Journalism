mps should be sent on ` honesty ' classes to ensure they adhere to ethical standards while in public office , the sleaze watchdog said last night .
the committee on standards in public life said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the ` seven principles of public life ' in the 1990s , fewer than one in five new mps attended induction meetings , and one workshop on dealing with ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled due to poor take-up .
the chairman of the committee , lord bew , said he was concerned that only small numbers of mps ever turned up at induction courses which are currently offered on ethical standards
