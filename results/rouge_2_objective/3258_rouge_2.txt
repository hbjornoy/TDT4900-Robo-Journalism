twin five-year-old girls who effectively have three mothers are at the centre of a fierce custody battle between the two lesbians who brought them into the world .
the children live with their birth mother but were conceived from eggs donated by her current partner .
under the human fertilisation and embryology act 2008 , the egg donor has no legal status as a parent .
she is fighting for a shared residence order which would allow her part-time custody of the girls -- and would recognise her as a third legal guardian .
