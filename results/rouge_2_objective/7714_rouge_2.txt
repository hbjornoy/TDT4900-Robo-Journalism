russia 's ekaterina makarova reached her second successive grand slam semi-final on tuesday , defeating third seed simona halep in the australian open .
neither player had lost a set in the previous four rounds but it was makarova who always looked the most likely winner , racing into a 3-0 lead with two breaks of serve as halep committed a string of unforced errors .
the 23-year-old romanian did recover one of the breaks to register her first game and held to trail 2-4 , but could not find another breakthrough as makarova made the most of her swinging left-handed serve .
