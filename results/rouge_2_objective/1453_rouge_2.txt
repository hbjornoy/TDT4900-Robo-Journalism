the discovery centres on a stone tool known as levallois technology , which involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone .
the find suggests eurasians were more innovative than previously thought and contradicts the widely-held belief that innovation spread as a result of humanity 's migration out of africa .
the top stones were created using ` bifacial technology ' where tools were created through the removal of flakes from a rock .
the flakes were found in sediments at a site in armenia between two ancient layers of lava dated to a period between 325,000 and 350,000 years ago .
