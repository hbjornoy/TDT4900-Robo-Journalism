russian driver was presumably left dazed and confused after he was attacked by a group dressed as cartoon characters including mickey mouse and spongebob squarepants in a bizarre road rage incident .
footage of the incident , which shows the driver as he stops his vehicle in front of a minibus in the middle of the road , has now become an internet hit .
the unverified footage , filmed on another vehicle 's dashboard camera , apparently shows the man as he gets out of his vehicle and appears to remonstrate with the driver of the minibus .
the group then appears to have taken place at about 2.30 am on saturday morning in the russian city of chelyabinsk
