mario bassi knew the old methodist chapel near cinderford in gloucestershire was the home for him as he walked through the door : he is 6ft 6in tall and it was a huge relief to have room above his head for once .
the spacious interior , large windows bringing in masses of light and the potential to create a unique home big enough for a family sold the victorian chapel to both mario and his wife caroline when they first saw it in 2004 .
