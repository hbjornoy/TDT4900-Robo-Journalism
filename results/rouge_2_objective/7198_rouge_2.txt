anthony straight , 49 , of romford , essex , found the birds in the grill seconds after turning his honda interceptor engine on before taking it out for a spin .
the birds now have been in the bike for about two and a half weeks which has meant mr straight has had to give up his wheels and find an alternative mode of transport .
the baby robins are expected to fledge in the next couple of days .
