sepp blatter was given an extraordinary mandate to carry on as fifa president for as long as he declared he is ready to stand for a fifth term next year .
this followed fifa congress delegates voting overwhelmingly against age and term limits for existing officials , paving the way for 78-year-old blatter to lead world football 's ruling body as an octogenarian and beyond .
he immediately hit back at fa chairman greg dyke and dutch chief michael van praag , who had called on him to stand down at uefa 's summit on tuesday .
blatter can remain indefinitely despite the scandal surrounding the 2022 world cup in qatar .
