lindsay demeloa , who moved from her new jersey hometown to los angeles a few years ago , shared her own scantily-clad selfie to instagram last week , captioned : ' i love my tiny booty and stick legs , and you should love every single inch of you as well ' concerns have arisen over two aspects of the movement ; the first being the safety issues associated with potentially underage girls exposing themselves on social media , and the second being the glorification of lindsay 's tiny frame .
she is thought to be in her 20s .
